"""Does a stage-3 model answer legal questions CORRECTLY? The gate before a release.

`chat_smoke.py` answers whether a model ends its turn. legal-it-4b v0.1c
passed it, 3 of 3, and then, read by a person, got both legal questions
wrong: article 2043 of the civil code became contractual good faith (artt.
1176 and 1375), and the ricorso straordinario was placed in article 111 of
the Constitution. Fluent, confident, invented. A format check cannot see
that, and "the loss went down" cannot either.

This asks every question of the held-out seed set
(`eullm_forge/eval/data/legal_it_heldout.seed.jsonl`), greedy, and scores
each answer by keyword coverage: the share of the terms a correct answer has
to contain that it does contain. Crude, and meant to be: it is
deterministic, it needs no judge model, and it ranks candidates on the same
questions. The answers are written out in full because the score only says
which model to READ first, not whether it is right. The seed items are
marked "da validare" and stay so until a lawyer has checked them.

Run it on every candidate AND on a reference, so a number means something:

    python forge/scripts/legal_eval.py <merged-dir or HF id> --label NAME \
        --csv legal-eval.csv --answers answers-NAME.jsonl

Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 is the reference: same size, Qwen's own
instruction tuning. A vertical that does not beat it on its own domain is not
worth shipping. Exit status is 0 whatever the scores; this reports.

OPEN BOOK. With ``--norms`` every question is asked with the text of the
norms `NormIndex` retrieves for it placed in front (the named article when
the question names one, BM25 otherwise). Same model, same questions, the
text in hand: the difference between the two runs is how much of the error
is memory rather than understanding. The retrieved records are written into
the answers file, so a wrong answer can be told apart from a wrong retrieval.

    python forge/scripts/legal_eval.py <model> --label NAME-open \
        --norms "$CORPUS_DIR"/legislazione_*.chunks.jsonl ...

The keyword score is a first sort. `judge_answers.py` grades the answers
files against the references with a large model, which is the number to
decide on.

THE FILE THAT SHIPS. With ``--gguf`` the answers come from that GGUF through
llama-server (`eullm_forge.eval.gguf`) instead of the bf16 weights; the
positional model is still the merged directory it was made from, whose
tokenizer builds the very same prompts. Two runs differing only in --gguf
measure what quantization costs on these questions:

    python forge/scripts/legal_eval.py <merged-dir> --label NAME-q4 \
        --gguf <merged-dir's q4_k_m.gguf> --norms ...

ABSTENTION. Every answer is also checked by program
(`eullm_forge.eval.abstain`): whether it says the texts do not hold the
answer (``abstained``), and which articles it cites that neither the question
nor the texts it was given name (``unsourced_articles``). Three runs of the
same exam then measure honesty, not only knowledge:

* open book: abstaining is a lost answer, the rate should be near 0;
* ``--absent`` (with ``--norms``): the item's own article is taken out of the
  retrieved texts, and no note says so -- what a RAG gives when retrieval
  misses. Abstaining is the right answer;
* closed book: no texts at all, as in a plain chat. Abstaining, or at least
  citing no article from memory, is the right answer.
