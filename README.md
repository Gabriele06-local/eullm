## EuLLM at a glance

| | |
|---|---|
| ⚡ **Decisions in milliseconds** | 64 questions about a page in 0.66 s, about 10 ms each, on one RTX 5070 Ti. The model gives the probability of every option and generates nothing. |
| 🎯 **A RAG gate that knows when to stop** | On Italian law it tells whether the retrieved text can answer: AUROC 0.90 against 0.79 for embeddings, and 2.5× fewer good answers blocked (Jev-Style 2B). |
| 🔁 **The same question, the same answer** | A decision does not move with the other questions asked beside it: bit for bit, checked on CPU and GPU. |
| 🧾 **Decisions you can audit, correct and learn from** | Every decision has an id in the local audit trail. Mark it right or wrong, keep a private trace, and train your own decision model with Forge. |
| 🐘 **A 125B model on a 16 GB GPU** | Qwen3.8-Flash-Next (125B, 6B active, IQ2_XS) writes 55 tokens/s on an RTX 5070 Ti with 64 GB of RAM: 2.5× the usual split, and long prompts read 3.8× faster. |
| 🚀 **Up to 62% faster answers** | `--mtp` lets the model draft its own next tokens: +62% on code, +27% on prose with Qwen3.5-9B. |
| 👥 **A long prompt never freezes the others** | With two slots, an 8,000-token prompt is read in 1.5 s while another answer keeps streaming; its longest pause is 108 ms. |
| 📈 **Sixteen users, one GPU** | Continuous batching: 259 tokens/s across 16 concurrent requests on one RTX 5070 Ti. |
| 🧠 **Several models, one server** | Chat models, an embedder and a decision model stay loaded side by side, each sized to the VRAM the others leave. |
| 🔌 **A drop-in for Ollama and OpenAI** | The same API on port 11434: Open WebUI, LangChain, n8n and any OpenAI client work unchanged. |
| 🔒 **Nothing leaves your machine** | No telemetry, no external API. Every answer and every decision goes to a local audit trail: model, tokens, timing, never the text. |
| 🌍 **From an ARM board to a supercomputer** | A 35B MoE at 10.8 tokens/s on an ARM board's CPU alone; tested on EuroHPC Leonardo and LUMI. |
| 🎓 **Models trained for your domain** | EuLLM Forge turns a large open model into a small specialist you own. Italian law comes first. |

</p>

A small model decides every move of this game of Snake on one RTX 5070 Ti,
**fast enough for the game to run in real time**. Nothing is
generated: EuLLM's [`/v1/systemone`](docs/engine-guide.md#decisions-without-generation-v1systemone-new-in-v0720)
reads, straight from the model, the probability of every option, and writes
each decision to the audit trail. No cloud, no external API.

Snake is only the part you can watch. The same call turns any state into a
structured decision:

| The state | The decision |
|---|---|
| a support ticket | route, escalate or close |
| an incoming email | which team, how urgent, legitimate or phishing |
| a document | accept, reject or send to review |
| an agent's state | its next tool or action |

Up to 64 questions about the same document go in one request: 64 questions
about a one-page document take 0.66 s with the Jev-Style 2B on the same GPU.
Try the [Snake and email triage examples](examples/README.md).

## Why EuLLM

- **100% local.** Prompts, documents and decisions never leave your
  machine: no telemetry, no external API, and every answer and decision
  written to a local audit trail (model, tokens, timing, never the text),
  designed for the EU AI Act's record-keeping.
- **A drop-in replacement.** The Ollama and OpenAI APIs on port 11434:
  Open WebUI, LangChain, n8n and any OpenAI client work unchanged.
- **Fast where it counts.** Continuous batching serves 16 users at once at
  259 tok/s on one RTX 5070 Ti; quantized KV cache for long contexts; images
  and audio as input; large MoE models on small GPUs.
- **Runs everywhere.** From a Raspberry Pi to an A100 node, with CUDA, ROCm,
  Vulkan, Metal and CPU builds of the same engine.
- **Models trained for your needs.** EuLLM Forge turns a general open model
  into a small specialist for your domain, your language and your brand,
  trained on European infrastructure and delivered as a file you own.

## Try it now

Download one binary, run any GGUF model (Qwen, Mistral, DeepSeek, Gemma, …)
and talk to it with the tools you already use:

```bash
# Linux / macOS: detects the OS and an NVIDIA GPU, checks the release checksums
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eullm/eullm/main/installer/install.sh | sh
eullm run hf.co/Qwen/Qwen3-8B-GGUF:Q4_K_M
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eullm/eullm/main/installer/install.ps1 | iex
```

```bash
# The same API your existing tooling already speaks
curl http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "qwen3", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Ciao!"}]}'
```

A chat UI opens on `http://localhost:11435/`. No Python, no Docker, no
account. Every download, for every platform: [platforms](docs/platforms.md).

## Runs everywhere: from an ARM board to a supercomputer

| Where | Measured |
|---|---|
| A desktop GPU, RTX 5070 Ti | 64 decisions in 0.66 s; 259 tok/s across 16 concurrent requests; a 125B MoE at 55 tok/s |
| An ARM board, no GPU: Radxa Orion O6 | a 35B MoE model (`qwen3.6-35b-a3b`) at 9–11 tok/s, on CPU alone |
| The same board with an RTX 3060 | qwen3-14b at 33 tok/s |
| EuroHPC **Leonardo**, NVIDIA A100 64 GB | a 27B model (Q8) at 32.4 tok/s on one GPU |
| EuroHPC **LUMI-G**, AMD MI250X | qwen3-8b at 40.7 tok/s on one GCD |

Also on Apple Silicon (Metal), Intel Macs, Windows, and AMD and Intel GPUs
through Vulkan, with an experimental ROCm build for recent Radeons on Windows.

## Models trained for your needs

A general model knows a little about everything. **EuLLM Forge** makes a
small one that knows your field: it prunes a large open model, distils it
into a smaller student, teaches it your domain, your language and your name,
and quantizes it into a GGUF that runs on a laptop with 8 GB of RAM. Your
brand is in the weights, not in a system prompt anyone can remove.

The first is **`legal-it-4b`**, for Italian law: a 4B model distilled from a
30B teacher, built on EuroHPC Leonardo. Forge is in development, and so are
the first models; [the roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) says what is ready and what
is next. **Want one for your domain?** We build them as a service:
[dev@eullm.eu](mailto:dev@eullm.eu).

## What's ready today

| | Status |
|---|---|
| **Engine**: inference, Ollama and OpenAI APIs, continuous batching, quantized KV cache, audit trail, chat UI | ✅ Ready, v0.7.50 |
| **Decisions** (`/v1/systemone`) | ✅ Since v0.7.20 |
| **Large MoE models on small GPUs** (`--moe-cache`), **MTP drafts** (`--mtp`), **several models at once**, **`model: "auto"`** | ✅ New in v0.7.30; the expert cache is experimental and needs one CUDA GPU |
| **Multimodal**: images and audio as input | ✅ Vision ready; audio experimental upstream |
| **Forge**: pruning, distillation, identity, quantization | 🧪 In development |
| **Hub**: EU-hosted model registry with AI Act cards | 🧪 Prototype |
| **Domain models**: `legal-it-4b`, then medicine and finance | 🚧 In training |

The engine works today, on its own, with any GGUF model: you do not need to
wait for Forge or the Hub.
