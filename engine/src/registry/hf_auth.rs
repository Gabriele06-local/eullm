//! `HF_TOKEN`: authenticated requests to Hugging Face, and to nothing else.
//!
//! Gated and private repositories answer an anonymous download with 401.
//! When `HF_TOKEN` is set, every request the registry makes to Hugging Face
//! carries it as a bearer token: the API (model info, file tree, search) and
//! every download — the range probe, each parallel range, the single-stream
//! fallback — for weights, shards and projectors alike, since they all go
//! through a [`RegistryClient`]. Unset, nothing changes: the same requests
//! go out as before, anonymous.
//!
//! Three rules keep the token where it belongs, each in one place:
//!
//! * **Per request, never a client default.** A default header would ride on
//!   every URL the client is handed, and `download_file` takes arbitrary
//!   ones. [`RegistryClient::get`] attaches the token only when
//!   [`is_hf_url`] says the address is Hugging Face's: `https`, the host
//!   exactly `huggingface.co`, the default port. Not a subdomain, not a
//!   look-alike, not plain `http`, and not `hf.co` either: it only redirects
//!   to `huggingface.co`, and a token sent to it would be dropped at that
//!   redirect, by the next rule. The client inside is private to this
//!   module, so nothing that holds a `RegistryClient` can make a request
//!   that skips the check.
//! * **Never across a redirect to another host.** A download is redirected
//!   from `huggingface.co` to a CDN (`us.aws.cdn.hf.co` and the like) with a
//!   pre-signed link, which needs no token. reqwest removes `Authorization`
//!   from a redirected request whenever the host or the port changes
//!   (`remove_sensitive_headers` in its `redirect.rs`); the promise above
//!   rests on that, so a test below holds reqwest to it.
//! * **Never printed or stored.** [`HfToken`] has no `Display`, its `Debug`
//!   is redacted, and reqwest marks the header sensitive. The token is never
//!   part of a URL, so the errors and log lines that name one cannot carry
//!   it, and it never reaches a manifest or the audit trail.
//!
//! It is read from the process environment only, under the name the Hugging
//! Face tools and llama.cpp's `-hf` read. There is no flag for it on
//! purpose: a secret on a command line is in `ps` for every local user.
