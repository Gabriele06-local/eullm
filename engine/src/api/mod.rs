//!
//! Exposes a standard LLM API (both `/api` and `/v1` OpenAI-compatible)
//! so that existing tools (Open WebUI, LangChain, n8n) work out of the box.
//!
//! Supports two inference backends:
//! - **Sequential** (`InferenceEngine`): one request at a time.
//! - **Continuous batching** (`SchedulerHandle`): multiple concurrent requests.
//!
//! Supports **models loaded on request**: when a request names a model that
//! is not loaded, the server loads it, and makes room first. With one model
//! at a time (`--max-loaded-models 1`, the default) that is a swap: the loaded
//! model goes, and requests it was still answering are cut off with an error,
//! as they always were. With several, the model goes only when the new one
//! needs its place or its memory, the least recently used first, and a busy
//! one is waited for rather than cut off. The residents are kept in
//! `resident::ResidentModels`.
