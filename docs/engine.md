# EULLM Engine

The EULLM Engine is a CLI + API server for running GGUF models locally, with real llama.cpp inference, built-in EU model catalog, local-only AI Act audit trail, and no network telemetry of any kind. Single Rust binary — no Python, no Docker.

## Installation

### From source

```bash
cd engine

# CPU only
cargo build --release

# With GPU acceleration
cargo build --release --features cuda     # NVIDIA (CUDA)
cargo build --release --features rocm     # AMD (ROCm)
cargo build --release --features vulkan   # Cross-platform (NVIDIA + AMD + Intel)
cargo build --release --features metal    # macOS Apple Silicon

# Binary will be at target/release/eullm
```

#### Build requirements

- Rust 1.75+
- C/C++ compiler (gcc/clang) — needed by llama.cpp
- CMake 3.14+
- libclang (`libclang-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu, `clang-devel` on Fedora) — needed by `bindgen` for FFI bindings
- (Optional) CUDA toolkit, ROCm, Vulkan SDK, or Xcode for GPU support

**Ubuntu/Debian one-liner:** `sudo apt install build-essential cmake libclang-dev`

### Docker

```bash
# CPU only
docker build -t eullm-engine engine/
docker run -p 11434:11434 -v eullm-models:/models eullm-engine

# With NVIDIA GPU

docker run --gpus all -p 11434:11434 -v eullm-models:/models eullm-engine

# Or via docker compose (from repo root)
docker compose up engine              # CPU
docker compose --profile gpu up engine-gpu   # GPU
```

## CLI Commands

### `eullm run <model> [--port PORT]`

Load a model and start the API server. Supports local GGUF files and catalog models.

```bash
# Run a local GGUF file (inference works immediately)
eullm run ./qwen3-7b-q4_k_m.gguf

# Run a catalog model (auto-downloads from HuggingFace)
eullm run legal-it-4b

# With options
eullm run ./model.gguf --port 8080
eullm run ./model.gguf --gpu-layers 0      # CPU only
eullm run ./model.gguf --gpu-layers 20     # At most 20 layers on the GPU
eullm run ./model.gguf --ctx-size 8192     # Larger context window
eullm run ./model.gguf --threads 8         # Limit CPU threads
```

**Options** (`eullm run --help` is authoritative; this table is the short form):

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `model` | (optional) | GGUF path, catalog id, URL, or `hf.co/<owner>/<repo>[:<quant>]`. Omitted on a terminal, opens the model picker |
| `--port, -p` | `11434` | API server port |
| `--ui-port` | `11435` | Embedded chat UI port (separate from the API) |
| `--gpu-layers` | automatic | **Upper bound** on GPU layers (-1 = all, 0 = CPU only). Sizing may offload fewer — see below |
| `--no-fit` | false | Disable automatic sizing; use `--gpu-layers` as given |
| `--fit` | (implied) | Same sizing, plus an interactive confirmation before a partial split |
| `--fit-strict` | false | Refuse to load rather than offload a partial split |
| `--cpu-moe` | false | MoE models: all expert tensors on CPU RAM (sized automatically when unset) |
| `--n-cpu-moe` | `0` | MoE models: expert tensors on CPU for the first N layers only |
| `--ctx-size, -c` | `4096` | Total context window (split across batch slots) |
| `--threads, -t` | all CPUs | Number of CPU threads |
| `--batch-size` | `1` | Concurrent requests served by the batching scheduler (raise `--ctx-size` with it) |
| `--n-batch` | `2048` | Prefill batch size (tokens per eval) |
| `--n-ubatch` | `512` | Prompt tokens one GPU pass reads (llama.cpp's micro-batch). Raise it, to 2048-8192, for an MoE model whose experts do not all fit in VRAM: the experts in RAM are copied to the GPU once per pass, so fewer passes read a long prompt faster. `--fit` keeps fewer experts on the GPU to make room. Raises `--n-batch` to match |
| `--moe-cache` | off | `auto` or a size in MiB: an MoE model whose experts do not all fit in VRAM keeps them all in RAM and caches the ones it uses most in the VRAM they would have taken. Speeds up writing, not prompt reading. One CUDA GPU only; experimental (llama.cpp PR #29887); see the guide |
| `--cache-type-k` | `f16` | KV cache type for keys (f16, q8_0, q4_0). Quantizing frees VRAM for more layers |
| `--cache-type-v` | `f16` | KV cache type for values (f16, q8_0, q4_0) |
| `--no-flash-attn` | false | Disable flash attention (on by default), for the generation model and the decision model alike |
| `--web` | false | Fetch URLs found in user messages and inject their content |
| `--mmproj` | (auto) | Multimodal projector path, when it is not beside the weights |
| `--ctx-checkpoints` | `0` | Prompt-prefix state snapshots for hybrid/recurrent models |
| `--checkpoint-min-step` | `8192` | Minimum new tokens between checkpoints |
| `--rs-seq` | `0` | Recurrent-state rollback window — leave off unless you know why |
| `--mtp` | `0` | Speculative decoding with the model's own MTP head: up to N drafted tokens checked per decode (2 measured best on a GPU). Needs a GGUF that carries the MTP layers and `--batch-size 1`; see the guide |
| `--mtp-p-min` | `0` | With `--mtp`: stop drafting once the MTP head is less sure than P (0-1) of its next draft, so the draft length follows the text |
| `--rust-debug` | false | Per-token NaN/Inf scan of the logits (diagnostics) |
| `--replace` | false | Replace an existing service on the port |
| `--daemon` | false | Run as a background daemon |
| `--pidfile` | `/tmp/eullm.pid` | PID file path (with `--daemon`) |
| `--logfile` | `~/.eullm/logs/eullm.log` | Daemon log file (with `--daemon`). Set `--pidfile` alone and the log stays beside it |
| `--keep-alive` | (unset) | Idle-unload a model this many seconds/minutes/hours after its last use (e.g. `5m`). Unset = never automatic; a request's own `keep_alive` field overrides it for that load. Applies to the generation, embedding and decision models independently. For a generation model the time counts from the end of its last request, and a model is never unloaded while a request is using it |
| `--embedding-model` | (unset) | Load a text-embedding model (GGUF path or store name) at startup as a **reserved companion**: its VRAM is subtracted from free VRAM before `--fit` sizes the generation model, so both stay resident together instead of depending on load order. See [Text Embeddings and the Embedding Slot](#text-embeddings-and-the-embedding-slot) |
| `--decision-model` | (unset) | Load a decision model for `POST /v1/systemone` at startup, as a reserved companion like `--embedding-model`. See [Decisions: `/v1/systemone`](#decisions-v1systemone-and-the-decision-slot) |
| `--max-loaded-models` | `1` | How many generation models stay loaded at once (1–16); embedding and decision models are not counted. Past it, the least recently used idle model is unloaded; above 1, a model answering requests is never unloaded to make room. At 1, a request for another model replaces the loaded one, as before. See [Several models at once](#several-models-at-once) |
| `--default-model` | (unset) | The model a request with no `model` field (or an empty one) goes to, loaded for it when needed; `auto` routes it. Unset: the most recently used model answers. See [The default model](#the-default-model) |
| `--auto-model` | (unset) | `NAME[=DESCRIPTION]`, repeatable, 2–8 times, smallest model first: the models `"model": "auto"` chooses between. See [`"model": "auto"`](#model-auto-the-decision-model-chooses-the-model) |
| `--auto-timeout-ms` | `1000` | The most routing may add to a request (10–60000) before the fallback answers |
| `--decision-ctx` | `8192` | Most tokens of context one `/v1/systemone` request may use: the state plus its longest question (plus every other question in `batched` mode). The context is sized per request; this ceiling is what the decision slot keeps free in VRAM |

#### Automatic GPU sizing

Since 0.6.80 the engine decides how much of the model goes on the GPU, on
every load — at startup and on every model swap, on `run` and on `serve`
alike. It reads free VRAM and the model's own metadata, then charges each
layer its share of the weights plus its KV-cache slice for the context and
cache type in use, and offloads as many layers as that budget allows. MoE
models get their expert tensors moved to CPU RAM first, since only a few
experts fire per token: that buys far more headroom than whole-layer
offload can.

You do not need a flag for this. It exists because the alternative default
is worse: a model larger than free VRAM used to die with an out-of-memory
error at load, while sized, the worst case is a slower partial split.

| You want | Use |
|---|---|
| The engine to decide | nothing — this is the default |
| To cap how much of the card is used | `--gpu-layers N` (an upper bound; sizing may go lower) |
| CPU only | `--gpu-layers 0` |
| To force a count past the estimate | `--no-fit --gpu-layers N` |
| To be asked before a partial split | `--fit` (interactive terminals only) |
| To refuse a load that doesn't fully fit | `--fit-strict` |

Three properties worth knowing.

`--gpu-layers` is a ceiling rather than a fixed count on purpose: a number
chosen against one model is not a fact about the next one the process loads,
and applying it blindly to a swapped-in model is exactly how an
out-of-memory error happens.

Automatic sizing never asks questions — it applies the split and logs one
line naming the flags that override it — because a default that interrupts
every launch is its own kind of failure. Where free VRAM cannot be probed
(any non-CUDA build) it stays silent and `--gpu-layers` is used as-is.

The budget leaves headroom on purpose, and it is the same headroom the
loader requires: enough of the card's total memory must stay free for the
context and its compute buffers, or the weights load and then no context can
be allocated at all. Sizing that aims past that floor produces a split the
loader refuses, which is a worse failure than a conservative one — so the
sizer takes the stricter of its own fragmentation margin and the loader's
minimum. Expect a loaded model to leave roughly 12% of the card free; that
is not waste, it is what the next token's compute buffer is allocated from.

### `eullm pull <model>`

Download a model from HuggingFace (or the EU registry when available).

```bash
eullm pull legal-it-4b
eullm pull eullm/legal-it-4b     # Full name works too
```

The model is stored in `~/.eullm/models/<model>/` with a GGUF file and manifest.

Gated and private Hugging Face repositories need an access token: set
`HF_TOKEN` in the environment (for a gated one, after accepting its terms with
the same account). It is sent only to `https://huggingface.co`, for the API
calls and every download request alike. See the README section "Gated and
private Hugging Face models".

### `eullm list`

Show locally downloaded models. If none are available, displays the EU catalog.

```bash
eullm list
```

### `eullm show <model>`

Display detailed information about a model (local or from catalog).

```bash
eullm show legal-it-4b
```

### `eullm serve [--port PORT]`

Start the API server without loading any model. The first API request with a `"model"` field will load that model dynamically.

```bash
eullm serve
eullm serve --port 8080
```

`serve` takes the same runtime flags as `run` (they are one shared set), and
they apply to every model it loads or swaps to: automatic GPU sizing runs on
each load, `--gpu-layers` caps it, `--no-fit` disables it. The one difference
is that `serve` never prompts — a daemon has nobody at the keyboard — so
`--fit` adds nothing there and `--fit-strict` surfaces a refused load as an
error to the API caller.

### `eullm unload [--model NAME]`

Unload generation models from a running server, freeing their VRAM, without
restarting it: every one, or with `--model` that one only, the others staying
loaded. Requests still running on an unloaded model are cut off. A later
request naming a model loads it again.

```bash
eullm unload                    # every generation model
eullm unload --model qwen3-8b   # this one only
eullm unload --port 11500
```

The same as `POST /api/unload` — see below.

### `eullm import-ollama <model> [--ollama-dir PATH]`

Import a model from a local Ollama installation into EULLM's model store. Copies the GGUF blob so you can benchmark both engines with the exact same model file.

```bash
# Import from Ollama (tag "latest")
eullm import-ollama llama3.2

# Import a specific tag
eullm import-ollama qwen3:14b

# Custom Ollama directory
eullm import-ollama gemma3 --ollama-dir /custom/path
```

**How it works:**

1. Reads the Ollama manifest at `~/.ollama/models/manifests/registry.ollama.ai/library/{name}/{tag}`
2. Locates the model layer (`application/vnd.ollama.image.model`) — the GGUF blob
3. Copies the blob to `~/.eullm/models/{name}/{name}.gguf`
4. Applies GGUF metadata patches if needed (e.g. fixes array lengths for llama.cpp compatibility)
5. Writes a EULLM manifest so the model appears in `eullm list`

After import:

```bash
eullm run llama3.2        # Runs on EULLM Engine
ollama run llama3.2       # Same model on Ollama — identical comparison
```

**Licensing note:** Ollama does not add any license on top of the original model weights. The GGUF blob is the same file distributed by the upstream model author. The license of the model itself applies (e.g. Apache 2.0 for Qwen3, MIT for DeepSeek).

**GGUF compatibility:** Some Ollama GGUF files contain metadata arrays with fewer elements than upstream llama.cpp expects (e.g. `qwen35.rope.dimension_sections` with 3 elements instead of 4). The import command automatically patches these during copy. Models with hybrid architectures (e.g. Qwen3.5 with SSM/Mamba2 layers) may have incompatible tensor layouts — use the HuggingFace GGUF instead.

### `eullm forge`

Delegate to the EULLM Forge Python pipeline for model verticalizzazione.

```bash
eullm forge Qwen/Qwen3-14B --profile legal-it --identity "LegalAI"
```

## Dynamic Model Swap

EULLM Engine loads models at runtime, like Ollama: a request names a model in
its `"model"` field, and a model that is not loaded is loaded for it. How many
stay loaded is `--max-loaded-models`. At 1, the default, a request for another
model replaces the loaded one — a swap; above 1, models stay loaded side by
side ([Several models at once](#several-models-at-once)). A request may also
name no model ([The default model](#the-default-model)), or `auto`, and let
the decision model choose ([`"model": "auto"`](#model-auto-the-decision-model-chooses-the-model)).

```bash
# Start with one model
eullm run qwen3-14b

# Any API request with a different model triggers a swap
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate \
  -d '{"model": "qwen3-7b", "prompt": "Ciao"}'
# → Unloads qwen3-14b, loads qwen3-7b, then responds

# Or start with no model and load on first request
eullm serve
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate \
  -d '{"model": "qwen3-14b", "prompt": "Ciao"}'
# → Loads qwen3-14b on the fly
```

**Behavior:**

- With one model at a time (the default), a swap cuts off the requests the old model is still answering: they end with the error `Server shutting down`. To keep several models loaded instead, see [Several models at once](#several-models-at-once)
- A model served sequentially — every multimodal model, and any with `--batch-size 0` — cannot be cut off, and is freed only when the requests running on it end, so a swap waits for them, up to 30 seconds, before the next model is sized against free VRAM
- The new model loads on a blocking thread, then atomically replaces the slot
- The model name must be an imported model (`eullm import-ollama`) or a local GGUF path

**What carries across a swap, and what does not.** The flags you launched
with are settings, and they apply to every model the process loads: context
size, cache types, batch size, thread count, and `--gpu-layers` as an upper
bound. What a *model* needs is decided per model, freshly, on each load:

| Per model, re-decided on every load | Why |
|---|---|
| How many layers go on the GPU | Sized against the VRAM actually free at that moment, for that model's own weights and KV cache |
| MoE expert offload | Only MoE models have experts to move |
| The multimodal projector | A projector belongs to the weights it was trained with; pairing it with another model fails the load |
| Sequential vs batched execution | Vision models need the sequential engine; text models get the scheduler back |

That split is not a detail: treating a per-model property as a process-wide
setting is how a launch model's projector ended up on its successors, and how
a layer count chosen for one model produced an out-of-memory error on the
next one.

### Several models at once

`--max-loaded-models N` (default 1, at most 16) keeps up to N generation
models loaded, so that requests alternating between models answer from memory
instead of reloading one each time. Embedding and decision models have slots
of their own and are not counted.

```bash
eullm serve --max-loaded-models 2
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{"model": "qwen3-4b", "prompt": "Ciao"}'
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{"model": "qwen3-8b", "prompt": "Ciao"}'
# → both stay loaded; the next request to either answers at once
```

How a model finds its place:

- **Below the limit**, a model a request names is loaded beside the others.
- **At the limit**, the least recently used idle model is unloaded first. A
  model whose keep_alive is over goes before any other, a model kept for good
  (`keep_alive: -1`, or no `--keep-alive`) after one that would expire, and
  the model `eullm run` started with goes last.
- **A model answering requests is never unloaded to make room.** When every
  model that could make room is busy, the load waits up to 120 seconds for one
  to finish, then answers 503 with `Retry-After: 5`. This holds from a limit
  of 2: at 1, the default, a request for another model replaces the loaded
  one even mid-answer, as it always did.
- **A model loads beside others only if it fits whole** on the GPU in what
  they leave free: every layer, and its projector. Otherwise models are
  unloaded until it fits, or until it is alone, when it is sized like any
  model loaded by itself, partial split included. The same rule as Ollama's
  ("new models must be able to completely fit in VRAM to allow concurrent
  model loads"): a second model only ever gets what the first one left, and
  splitting it silently would divide the card. Without automatic sizing
  (`--no-fit`, or a build that cannot read free VRAM) only the count is kept,
  and the server says so at startup.
- **An embedding or decision model loaded by a request** (not a reserved
  `--embedding-model` or `--decision-model`) that does not fit in the VRAM
  left free unloads generation models the same way — the least recently used
  idle one first, one at a time, and only as many as it needs. Each counts in
  `model_swaps`.
- A request with no `model` field is answered by `--default-model`, or
  without it by the most recently used model.

Requests to a model that is loaded never wait for another model's load.
`GET /api/ps` lists what is loaded, with what each model holds and when it
expires. `/api/version` reports `max_loaded_models`, `loaded_models`, and
`generation_evictions` (how many models were unloaded to make room; a steady
rate of one per request means the models asked for do not fit together).

Unlike Ollama's `OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS`, this is a command-line flag, not an
environment variable, and it counts generation models only, defaulting to 1
rather than three per GPU. The server says so at startup when the variable is
set.

**On a machine without a GPU**, run the server with
`OMP_WAIT_POLICY=PASSIVE`. Each model computes on its own pool of OpenMP
threads, one per core, and by default a pool's threads spin for a while after
each step waiting for the next one, taking the cores another model is
computing on. Measured with two tiny models on a CPU, a request's time to
first token went from 34.5 ms alone to 235.8 ms while the other model was
loading. `PASSIVE` makes waiting threads sleep instead. On a GPU the threads
mostly wait on the device, and the setting matters little.

```bash
OMP_WAIT_POLICY=PASSIVE eullm serve --max-loaded-models 2
```

### The default model

`--default-model NAME` (a store name or a GGUF path) is the model a request
with no `model` field, or an empty one, goes to — on `/api/generate`,
`/api/chat` and `/v1/chat/completions` — loaded for it as if the request had
named it. An empty request with `keep_alive: 0` unloads it. A name that is no
model stops the server at startup. `--default-model auto`, with
`--auto-model`, routes such requests as `"model": "auto"` is routed. Without
the flag a request that names no model is answered by the most recently used
model, and refused with 503 when none is loaded.

## `"model": "auto"`: the decision model chooses the model

With two to eight `--auto-model` and a `--decision-model`, a request naming
the model `auto` (in any case) is answered by one of the candidates, chosen
for it by the decision model: the small one when it will answer correctly and
completely, a larger one when the request needs more reasoning, knowledge,
code or length. The large model answers only what needs it.

```bash
eullm serve --max-loaded-models 2 \
  --auto-model 'qwen3-4b=Short everyday requests, simple facts and quick rewrites' \
  --auto-model 'qwen3-8b=Multi-step reasoning, maths, code, analysis and long answers' \
  --decision-model /models/Jev-Style-0.8B-Decision-v3-Q4_K_M.gguf
curl http://localhost:11434/api/chat -d '{"model": "auto", "stream": false,
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}]}'
```

**Candidates.** `--auto-model NAME=DESCRIPTION`, smallest model first: the
order is the order the decision model reads them in. The description is what
it reads about each, up to 400 characters; without one it reads the store
manifest's description, else the catalog's, else the name — the server warns
about the last two, which describe a product rather than what the model is
good at. `auto` itself, a model given twice, or a name that is no model stops
the server at startup. `--max-loaded-models` should hold every candidate;
the server warns when it does not, since every switch would then reload a
model.

**What the decision model reads.** One `choice` question, with a candidate as
each option, about a digest of the request built by code: the start of the
system instructions, the last turns before the latest message shortened, the
latest message whole (its head and tail when very long), the attachments and
the tool names. The text is never stored in the audit trail, only its SHA-256.

**Code filters first.** A candidate that cannot read the request's images or
audio (no projector), or whose context is shorter than the request, is not
offered. With one candidate left there is nothing to decide; with none, the
fallback answers, and fails as a request naming it would.

**The fallback** is `--default-model` when it is a candidate, the last
candidate otherwise. It answers whenever the decision model does not decide,
and the reason says why:

| Reason | When |
|---|---|
| `decided` | The decision model chose: the most likely candidate, no threshold |
| `no_decision_model` | No `--decision-model`, or it was unloaded (by `--keep-alive`, say) |
| `timeout` | The decision took longer than `--auto-timeout-ms` (1000); it is cancelled |
| `decision_error` | The decision model could not decide (the request over its budget, a failure) |
| `only_candidate` / `no_eligible_candidate` | The filters left one candidate, or none |
| `load_failed` | The chosen model would not load: the fallback answered in its place, once |

**Latency.** A decision is one forward pass of the decision model over the
digest: tens of milliseconds on a GPU. One decision runs at a time per
decision model, so routed requests and `/v1/systemone` traffic queue behind
each other; `--auto-timeout-ms` bounds the wait. On a CPU a decision takes a
second or more — measured with Qwen3-0.6B as the decision model, every route
timed out at the default 1000 ms — so `auto` there answers with the fallback
unless the timeout is raised, and then every request waits for its decision.

**Which model answered, and why.** The `model` field of the response, and of
every streamed line or chunk, is the model that answered. The headers, sent
before the body, say the same — `X-EuLLM-Model`, `X-EuLLM-Route` (the reason)
and `X-EuLLM-Route-Id` — and the response, or the last line or chunk of a
stream, carries:

```json
"eullm": {"route": {"requested": "auto", "model": "qwen3-4b", "reason": "decided",
  "confidence": 0.71, "probabilities": {"qwen3-4b": 0.85, "qwen3-8b": 0.15},
  "decision_model": "Jev-Style-0.8B-Decision-v3-Q4_K_M", "decision_ms": 38.2, "id": "<uuid>"}}
```

Ollama and OpenAI clients ignore it. The audit trail has one `route` line per
routed request, under the route's id: the candidates offered and excluded,
the decision record as `/v1/systemone` writes it, the reason and the time.
The answer's own line names it in `route.id`, and says in `route.fallback`
when the chosen model did not load.

**Loading.** Once the server listens, it loads the candidates, the fallback
first, as far as they fit without unloading anything, and logs how many it
loaded. An empty request naming `auto` (an empty prompt, or empty messages)
does the same, and with `keep_alive: 0` unloads every candidate; both answer
with `"model": "auto"`. `auto` is listed in `/api/tags`, with
`details.family: "eullm-router"` and its candidates, and in `/v1/models`.

**Limits.** A `raw` prompt on `/api/generate` is written for one model's
template and gets a 400. There is no filter on tool support: a request with
tools may go to a candidate that cannot call them. `/api/show` does not know
`auto`. Without `--auto-model`, `auto` is a model name like any other, and a
404.

**Checking the choice without generating.** [`POST /api/route`](#post-apiroute)
takes the same body and answers with the route, the digest and the question
— the way to tune the descriptions, and what `bench/reflexbench/autobench.py`
measures routing with.

## KV Cache Quantization

By default, EULLM uses F16 KV cache for maximum GPU compatibility. Quantized types save VRAM but may cause GPU compute fallback to CPU on some architectures — verify GPU utilisation with `nvtop` before deploying in production.

| Setting | VRAM for 14B @ 16K context |
|---------|---------------------------|
| **`--cache-type-k f16 --cache-type-v f16`** | **~10 GB (default, best GPU compat)** |
| `--cache-type-k q8_0 --cache-type-v q8_0` | ~5 GB |
| `--cache-type-k q8_0 --cache-type-v q4_0` | ~2.5 GB (⚠️ verify GPU usage) |

```bash
# Default (F16) — maximum GPU compatibility
eullm run qwen3-14b --ctx-size 8192

# Save VRAM with quantized KV cache (check GPU usage with nvtop!)
eullm run qwen3-14b --ctx-size 16384 --cache-type-k q8_0 --cache-type-v q4_0

# Aggressive quantization (minimum VRAM, may fall back to CPU)
eullm run qwen3-14b --ctx-size 32768 --cache-type-k q4_0 --cache-type-v q4_0
```

Available types: `f16`, `f32`, `q8_0`, `q4_0`, `q4_1`, `q5_0`, `q5_1`.

> **Note:** Quantized V cache types (Q4_0, Q8_0) require Flash Attention. On GPUs where Flash Attention doesn't support these types, the engine automatically falls back to F16 KV cache and logs a warning. You can also set F16 explicitly by omitting the `--cache-type-v` flag.
>
> **TurboQuant note:** v0.5.x of the engine integrated an experimental TurboQuant (Walsh-Hadamard + Lloyd-Max) KV compression via the AmesianX/llama.cpp fork. It is **not in v0.5.8 onwards** — see [Research and experiments](research.md) and the archived numbers in [`turboquant-quality-report.md`](turboquant-quality-report.md) / [`turboquant-kv-stress-report.md`](turboquant-kv-stress-report.md).

## Constrained JSON Decoding (`format: "json"`)

When `format: "json"` is set in a request, EULLM uses GBNF grammar-based constrained decoding to guarantee valid JSON output. This matches Ollama's behavior and prevents malformed JSON in extraction pipelines.

```bash
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen3-14b",
    "prompt": "Extract the name and age from: John is 30 years old",
    "format": "json"
  }'
# → Always returns valid JSON: {"name": "John", "age": 30}
```

Works on all endpoints: `/api/generate`, `/api/chat`, `/v1/chat/completions`. Both sequential and continuous batching modes.

## Continuous Batching

EULLM's continuous batching scheduler decodes multiple requests in parallel on a single GPU pass. This is a key performance differentiator over Ollama, which processes requests one at a time.

```bash
# Enable continuous batching with 8 parallel slots (default)
eullm run ./model.gguf --batch-size 8

# More slots for high-throughput RAG workloads
eullm run ./model.gguf --batch-size 16

# Sequential mode (one request at a time, like Ollama)
eullm run ./model.gguf --batch-size 0
```

With 16 concurrent requests on a consumer GPU, EULLM achieves ~2.5x throughput vs Ollama. See [benchmarks](benchmarks.md) for details.

### Context window and batch slots

The `--ctx-size` flag sets the **total** KV cache budget, shared across all batch slots (matching Ollama/llama.cpp server behaviour). Each slot gets `ctx_size / batch_size` tokens of context:

```bash
# 16K total, 4 slots → 4096 tokens/slot
eullm run ./model.gguf --ctx-size 16384 --batch-size 4

# 32K total, 8 slots → 4096 tokens/slot
eullm run ./model.gguf --ctx-size 32768 --batch-size 8
```

### Choosing batch-size

More slots increase parallelism but reduce per-request throughput (shared GPU time). General guideline:

| Parallel slots | Per-request throughput | Aggregate throughput | Use case |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|---|
| 4 | High | High | Chat, general inference |
| 8 | Medium | Higher | Batch extraction, RAG pipelines |
| 16+ | Lower | Highest | High-concurrency APIs, multi-GPU |

Start with `--batch-size 4` for the best per-request latency. Increase when your workload requires more concurrent slots and can tolerate slower individual responses.

## Loading a Model: Slots, Context and Names

When a request names a model that is not loaded, the server:

1. **Makes room** for it: with one model at a time, the default, it shuts down
   the loaded model's scheduler thread (waiting for it to fully exit) and frees
   its VRAM; with `--max-loaded-models` above 1, it unloads a model only when
   the new one needs its place or its memory — see [Several models at
   once](#several-models-at-once)
2. **Sizes** the new model against the VRAM now free, and **loads** it with the
   requested configuration
3. **Serves** the request on it, and every later request that names it

### Basic swap (via model field)

Any generation request with a different `model` triggers the swap:

```bash
# Currently running qwen3-14b — this switches to qwen3-8b automatically
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "qwen3:8b",
  "prompt": "Hello"
}'
```

### Dynamic batch_size and ctx_size

The `batch_size` and `ctx_size` can be overridden per model swap. This is useful when switching between a large model (fewer slots) and a small model (more slots):

```bash
# Switch to 8B with 8 parallel slots and 32K context
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "qwen3:8b",
  "batch_size": 8,
  "ctx_size": 32768,
  "prompt": "Hello"
}'

# Switch back to 14B with 4 slots and 16K context
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "qwen3:14b",
  "batch_size": 4,
  "ctx_size": 16384,
  "prompt": "Hello"
}'
```

When `batch_size` or `ctx_size` are not specified, the values from `--batch-size` and `--ctx-size` at startup are used.

### Model name resolution

The `model` field accepts:

| Format | Example | Resolution |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Full GGUF path | `/models/qwen3-8b.gguf` | Direct file |
| Ollama-style name | `qwen3:8b` | Normalized to `qwen3-8b`, searched in `/models/` and model store |
| Path without extension | `/models/qwen3-8b` | Tries appending `.gguf` |
| Directory | `/models/mymodel/` | Picks the first `.gguf` file inside |
| Registered name | `legal-it-4b` | Looked up in `~/.eullm/models/` |

A model is its file, whatever it is called: a request that names the loaded
model's GGUF another way — its path, or a second name `eullm pull` linked to
the same weights — is answered by the model already loaded, under the name it
was loaded with, instead of loading the same weights again.

### Concurrent swap safety

Multiple requests arriving simultaneously for a different model are handled safely:
- Only one load runs at a time (serialized via Mutex); requests to a model that is already loaded do not wait for it. A load waiting for a busy model to finish lets go of the lock meanwhile, so embedding and decision loads are not held up by it
- Other requests for the model being loaded wait for the load to complete, then use it
- With one model at a time (the default), requests the old model is still answering are cut off with an error, except on a sequential engine, which finishes them before it is freed. With `--max-loaded-models` above 1, a model answering requests is never unloaded to make room — see [Several models at once](#several-models-at-once)

### VRAM budget reference

Approximate VRAM usage with F16 KV cache (default). Actual values depend on model architecture and GPU.

| Model size | batch_size | ctx_size | tok/slot | VRAM est. |
|:----------:|:----------:|:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|
| 14B Q4 | 4 | 16384 | 4096 | ~12.5 GB |
| 8B Q4 | 4 | 16384 | 4096 | ~7 GB |
| 8B Q4 | 8 | 32768 | 4096 | ~9.5 GB |
| 8B Q4 | 8 | 16384 | 2048 | ~7 GB |
| 70B Q4 | 16 | 65536 | 4096 | ~45 GB |

## Text Embeddings and the Embedding Slot

`POST /api/embed` (Ollama) and `POST /v1/embeddings` (OpenAI) embed one or
more texts with any GGUF text-embedding model — BGE, E5, and similar.
Naming a model in the request loads it the first time it is requested,
exactly like the generation model:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:11434/api/embed -d '{
  "model": "bge-m3",
  "input": ["first chunk", "second chunk"]
}'
```

The embedding model lives in a **second, independent slot** — it does not
replace whatever generation model is loaded. Both are kept resident when
they fit; this is a decision the server makes for itself on every embedding
request, not something the caller has to reason about:

- If the embedding model fits in currently free VRAM alongside the loaded
  generation model, it is loaded next to it. Both stay resident.
- If it does not fit, the generation model is evicted first (it reloads
  automatically on the next generation request), and the embedder gets the
  whole card.
- The reverse also holds: a generation request with `--fit` enabled evicts
  a resident embedder first if the sizing needs the VRAM back.

On a build with no VRAM probe (non-CUDA), the server always tries to keep
both resident and lets a genuine out-of-memory surface as a normal load
error — the same posture `--fit` itself takes there.

How many times either direction of eviction has happened is in
`/api/version`'s `model_swaps` field — a rate of roughly one per request
means a card too small for both is being asked to alternate rather than
batch (do all ingestion, then all generation, rather than interleaving).

The eviction dance above assumes the embedding model was loaded on demand,
by naming it in a request. `--embedding-model <path-or-name>` skips that:
the embedder loads at startup and becomes a **reserved companion** — it
loads first, with the context its inputs are embedded in, built for its
longest input and kept for every request, so both already count as used
VRAM by the time `--fit` reads free VRAM to size the generation model, on
both `eullm run` and `eullm serve`; `--fit` additionally keeps a small
margin free on top, for what a decode allocates beside them, both at launch
and again on every later generation-model swap. That context is memory the
embedder holds from startup — about 1.4 GB for Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B at the
default 2,048 tokens, measured on an RTX 5070 Ti — and what guarantees that a long input never fails for lack of room next to a
generation model sized to fill the card. A reserved
companion is never evicted to make room for a generation load; it keeps its
place for the life of the process. If reserving its space would leave the
generation model no room at all, the launch proceeds anyway with a warning:
the reservation is dropped and the embedder falls back to the normal
evict-on-demand behavior described above, exactly as if the flag had not
been given.

```bash
eullm run legal-it-4b --fit --embedding-model bge-m3
```

Use this when a companion (e.g. bge-m3 for a RAG pipeline) should always be
resident alongside the generation model whenever the card has room for both,
rather than depending on which model happens to be requested first.

Requests name the companion as it was given: by its store name, as `eullm
list` shows it (`--embedding-model qwen3-embedding-0.6b-gguf-q8_0`), or by
its file name when it was given as a path. A request naming the same file
any other way finds it too, and is answered by the model already loaded.

The embedder keeps one context from one request to the next, grown when
an input needs more room than it has and never shrunk, and embeds the
inputs of every request in it one at a time, in the order they came: a
request of many inputs holds back a short one for one input, not for all
of them, and a burst waits instead of failing for lack of memory. Building
that context was most of what a request cost: on an RTX 5070 Ti with
Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B, a 1,966-token input took 1,001 ms when every request
built its own and takes about 97 ms in the kept one; a 62-token input, 40
ms then and about 7 ms now. An embedder loaded on demand builds its context
when its first input comes; a reserved companion builds it at startup.

Pooling is read from the model's own GGUF metadata (CLS for BGE, mean for
E5, and so on) rather than guessed; a model that declares no pooling type
falls back to mean-pooling its per-token embeddings. Output vectors are
L2-normalized. Rerankers (RANK-pooling models) are out of scope for this
endpoint — normalizing a single relevance score would collapse it.

## Decisions: `/v1/systemone` and the Decision Slot

`POST /v1/systemone` answers typed questions about a *state* — a ticket, a
document, a conversation, a JSON object — without generating any text. It
takes the request and response shape of the System One API (TypeSafe's
Jev), so a client written for it can point its base URL at EuLLM. Three
question types:

| Type | Question | Answer |
|---|---|---|
| `noul` | Is this statement true of the state? (`criteria`, optional: `{"true": "…", "false": "…"}`, what each answer means) | `noul`: P(yes) |
| `choice` | Which of these options? (`criteria`: an object of name → description, 2–26 options; up to 255 with a [Jev-Style model](#jev-style-decision-models)) | `choice`, `probabilities`, `confidence` |
| `score` | Which level of this scale? (`criteria`: an array of 2–10 level descriptions, lowest first; a level may also be `{"label": "…", "description": "…"}`) | `score` (Σ level × p), `legend`, `probabilities`, `confidence` |

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:11434/v1/systemone -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
  "state": "Help! My payouts have been failing for 3 days.",
  "questions": {
    "is_urgent": { "type": "noul", "instructions": "Does this convey urgency?" },
    "team": { "type": "choice", "instructions": "Which team should handle it?",
              "criteria": { "billing": "Payments and payouts", "tech": "Bugs", "other": "Anything else" } },
    "severity": { "type": "score", "instructions": "How severe is it?",
                  "criteria": ["Cosmetic", "Degraded, with a workaround", "Blocking"] }
  }
}'
```

```json
{
  "model": "qwen3-4b",
  "answers": {
    "is_urgent": { "type": "noul", "noul": 0.95, "eullm": { ... } },
    "team": { "type": "choice", "choice": "billing",
              "probabilities": { "billing": 0.91, "tech": 0.07, "other": 0.02 },
              "confidence": 0.865, "eullm": { ... } },
    "severity": { "type": "score", "score": 1.43,
                  "legend": { "0": "Cosmetic", "1": "Degraded, with a workaround", "2": "Blocking" },
                  "probabilities": { "0": 0.0, "1": 0.57, "2": 0.43 },
                  "confidence": 0.355, "eullm": { ... } }
  },
  "usage": { "input_tokens": 312, "output_tokens": 0 },
  "timing": { "total_ms": 187.4 },
  "eullm": { "audit_id": "b1149e83-332b-48c0-bab7-53725922c4de", "mode": "shared_prefix",
             "prompt_tokens": 520, "shared_prefix_tokens": 104, "evaluated_tokens": 312,
             "timings_ms": { ... }, "request_ms": 187.43, ... }
}
```

`timing.total_ms` is the request's wall time, model resolution included, as
jev-style's server reports it and its MCP tools and guard show it:
`eullm.request_ms` to 0.1 ms. `eullm.timings_ms` splits the decode into its
phases.

`eullm.audit_id` is the decision's `id` in the audit trail, and in the
[decision traces](#decision-traces-eullm_decision_traces) when they are on:
the id to [give feedback](#feedback-post-v1systemonefeedback) under. It is
inside `eullm`, not at the top level, because the System One SDKs' response
models are strict and refuse a key they do not know.

Answers and options come back in the order the request listed them; options
are shown to the model lettered in that order.

`instructions` may be a string, or, as the System One API allows, an object
or an array — the question in one field and the data it refers to in
others. The model then reads it as one line of compact JSON, in the order
it was written, which is what jev-style's server gives its models:

```json
{"record":{"name":"John Smith","city":"Oakland"},"question":"Is this resume the same person as the record?"}
```

A score level written as `{"label": "high", "description": "loses data"}` is
shown to the model as `high: loses data` — the label alone when there is no
description — and named `high` in the `legend`, as jev-style's own server
does. Any other object or array is shown as one line of JSON and named in the
legend by its label, when it has one, or by its compact JSON.

**How an answer is computed.** With an instruction-tuned model — the *code
readout* — each question becomes one chat prompt (the model's own template,
reasoning switched off) ending where the answer would begin, with the
options coded `A`…`Z`, the levels `0`…`9`, or `Yes`/`No`. The logits at
that position are read once — nothing is generated — and restricted to the
codes. When the model loads, the server checks that every code is a single
token for its tokenizer right after its prompt, and refuses a question whose
codes are not; the load log lists what it found. Everything a request
sends — the state, the instructions, the options — is tokenized as text: a
chat template's own turn markers inside it (`<|im_end|>`,
`<|im_start|>assistant`) stay text instead of closing the user turn and
writing the rest of the prompt. Only the template's text is read for control
tokens; for the rare template that cannot be tokenized in those pieces
exactly as it is whole, a request containing such a marker is refused with
a 422. A model trained for this endpoint reads its answers differently — see
[Jev-Style decision models](#jev-style-decision-models) — and the response
says which readout was used in `eullm.readout` (`codes` or `verdict`).

Next to the System One fields, every answer carries an `eullm` object with
what it was derived from, so a stored response can be re-examined or
re-calibrated later:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `logprobs` | Code readout: full-vocabulary log-probability of each answer's code |
| `scores` | Verdict readout: each option's score, `logit(" yes") − logit(" no")` at its slot |
| `raw_probabilities` | The same, renormalized over the answers (a softmax of the scores), before calibration and temperature |
| `coverage` | Code readout: share of the model's probability on a valid code. Near 1: it answered in the format asked for. Low: most of its probability went elsewhere (a thinking tag, a sentence) and the answer describes a minority of what it would have said — check this before trusting an answer |
| `prior_logprobs` | The content-free prior that was divided out (with `content_free` calibration only) |
| `confidence_entropy` | `choice` and `score`: `1 − H(p) / ln K` of the same probabilities, `confidence` as it was defined up to 0.7.20 |

`confidence` (for `choice` and `score`) is `(K · p_max − 1) / (K − 1)` over
the `K` answers, clipped to [0, 1]: how far the top answer's probability is
above an even split, as a share of the most it could be — 1 when all
probability is on one answer, 0 when it is spread evenly; `2 · p_max − 1`
for two options. It is jev-style's definition, so a threshold on it means
the same against jev-style's server and against EuLLM. The response names
it in `eullm.confidence_method` (`normalized_max_probability`), and each
answer's `eullm.confidence_entropy` keeps `1 − H(p) / ln K`, the
entropy-based value `confidence` was up to 0.7.20, which reads the
runner-up answers too.

**Calibration is not a solved problem here, and nothing is claimed about
it yet.** The mechanism reproduces with any model; calibrated probabilities
do not come with it. The request's `eullm` object picks what is applied, so
the options can be compared on labelled data before one is trusted:

| `eullm` option | Values | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `calibration` | `none`; `content_free` (code readout): divide out the answer the model gives the same question about the state `N/A` (Zhao et al., 2021), cached per question | `none` |
| `temperature` | Temperature scaling after calibration: `> 1` flattens, `< 1` sharpens | `1`; the model's own calibration temperature when it has one (below) |
| `mode` | `shared_prefix`; `batched`; `separate` (see below) | `shared_prefix` |

The content-free prior is not always noise to remove: when the options
themselves imply a base rate, dividing it out moves probability towards
options that are rarely right. Measure before choosing.

**A model's own temperature.** A decision model can bring the temperature
it was calibrated with: a Jev-Style release has one built in (see
[Jev-Style decision models](#jev-style-decision-models)), and a model Forge
trains is calibrated on held-out data and carries the fitted value in its
GGUF, as the metadata key `eullm.decision.temperature` (a `FLOAT32` or
`FLOAT64`). A code-readout model whose GGUF has that key scales its
probabilities with it by default. A request's `temperature` still overrides
it, and the response's `eullm.temperature` says which one was applied. The
value has to pass the same check as a request's — greater than 0 and at
most 100 — and anything else (another type, `NaN`, `0`, `250`) is ignored
with a warning that names it: the model loads anyway, its probabilities
unscaled. The load log prints the temperature in effect and where it came
from:

```text
Decision model loaded — codes: …; prompts: …; calibration temperature 0.8730 (the GGUF's eullm.decision.temperature); …
Decision model loaded — codes: …; prompts: …; calibration temperature 1 (none: the GGUF has no eullm.decision.temperature); …
```

A Jev-Style model keeps its release's temperature even when its GGUF
carries this key, and the log warns when the two differ.

**Many questions, one pass.** Every question's prompt starts with the same
tokens — system prompt, template, the state — and differs only at the end.
`shared_prefix` decodes that common part once, then each question on its
own right after it, in a sequence that starts as a copy of the state's (no
copy of data: on a unified cache the cells are only tagged with the extra
sequence) and is dropped once the question's answer is read: about
`S + Q·q` tokens for `Q` questions of `q` tokens on a state of `S`, instead
of the `Q·(S + q)` of asking one at a time. `batched` decodes the same
tokens, but every question's in one batch: fewer, larger decode calls.
`separate` asks one question at a time from an empty cache; it exists as
the baseline. The response reports the token counts (`prompt_tokens`
against `evaluated_tokens`), the timings of each phase and `flash_attn` —
`auto`, or `off` under `--no-flash-attn` — since both the timings and the
last digits of every probability depend on it. `bench/decision_bench.py`
measures all three for 1–64 questions on states of several sizes.

**Each answer depends on its own question only.** The three modes read the
same tokens but hand them to the kernels in batches of different shapes,
and on quantized weights that alone moves an answer — a quantized model's
matrix products round their inputs to 8 bits, which turns a last-digit
difference in a sum into a different rounding one layer later. How far,
measured with `bench/decision_bench.py` (the largest difference in any
probability from `separate`; on the CPU over states of 256 and 1,024 tokens
with 1–64 questions, on the GPU with the benchmark's defaults):

| Model | 4-core CPU: `shared_prefix` | `batched` | RTX 5070 Ti: `shared_prefix` | `batched` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen3-0.6B F16 | 0.017 | 0.017 | | |
| Qwen3-0.6B Q8_0 | 0.11 | 0.13 | | |
| Qwen3-0.6B Q4_K_M | 0.34 | 0.32 | 0.53 | 0.52 |
| Jev-Style-0.8B-Decision-v3 Q4_K_M | 0.024 | 0.028 | 0.039 | 0.033 |
| Jev-Style-2B-Decision-v3 Q4_K_M | | | 0 | 0 |

With Qwen3-0.6B Q4_K_M, the catalog's `qwen3-0.6b`, that is enough to
change the top answer of a question near a tie, and more so on CUDA, where
the arithmetic is coarser: ggml-cuda runs cuBLAS in TF32 mode and
accumulates some F16 products in half precision. None of the modes is the
exact one; they are the same model with different rounding. The Jev-Style
models, trained to answer this way, are an order of magnitude steadier than
an instruction-tuned model at the same quantization, and the 2B's modes read
the same blocks, so they agree exactly (see
[below](#jev-style-decision-models)).

What differs is what the rounding depends on. In `batched` mode a question
sits somewhere in a batch with the others, so its answer moves with the
other questions asked and with their order: asking the same questions in
reverse moved answers by up to 0.31 on the CPU (Q4_K_M). In `shared_prefix`
mode a question is decoded alone, in the same cache cells, in batches of the
same shape and over the same attention window whatever else the request
asks, so its answer is a function of the state and that question: asked
alone, among 63 others or in reverse order, it comes back bit for bit the
same (measured on the CPU and on an RTX 5070 Ti;
`bench/decision_bench.py --order-check` checks it on your
hardware and fails if it does not hold). That is the default because a
decision should not change with the questions asked next to it, and
because a calibration measured on labelled data then holds however the
questions are grouped into requests when serving. The price is one decode
call per question instead of one per batch. On a 4-core CPU that is 2–14%
slower than `batched`. On a GPU each call has a fixed cost of about 3 ms
(Qwen3-0.6B on an RTX 5070 Ti) — the GPU running a few hundred small
kernels, not launching them: padding every question to a common length so
the calls replay as CUDA graphs was tried and measured 25% slower — so with
many questions `shared_prefix` is 2–3× slower than `batched` there, and
still 2–5× faster than `separate`. Measured with 64 questions: 316 / 347 /
473 ms for states of 256 / 1k / 4k tokens, against 111 / 130 / 235 ms
`batched` and 630 / 1645 ms / — `separate`. Calibrate in the mode that
will serve.

**Limits:** 64 questions per request, 2–26 options per `choice` (up to 255
with a Jev-Style model), 2–10 levels per `score`, and `--decision-ctx` tokens
of context per request (default 8192). A request over the context limit is
refused with a 422 `input_budget_exceeded` that says how many tokens it
needed; nothing is truncated.

**One option is not a choice.** jev-style accepts a `choice` with a single
option — the System One API documents a maximum of 255 and no minimum — and
answers it with that option at probability 1 and confidence 1, whatever the
state says. EuLLM refuses it with a 422 `invalid_question`, and requires two:
with one option there is nothing to decide, the answer is known before the
model reads anything, and returning it as a decision would only look like
one. To ask whether that one option fits, ask a `noul` about it, which
returns the probability that it does.

**Errors** come back in the shape System One clients and
[jev-style](https://github.com/lawrence3699/jev-style)'s parse — a
status and `{"error": {"code": "…", "message": "…", "question": "…"}}`, with
`question` present when one question is at fault — so its MCP server, CLI
and guard show EuLLM's message instead of failing on the body:

| Status | `code` | When |
|---|---|---|
| 422 | `invalid_json` | The body is not JSON |
| 422 | `invalid_request` | The request as a whole fails validation: no `state`, no questions, more than 64, an unknown `eullm` option |
| 422 | `invalid_question` | One question fails validation — an unknown `type`, one option, 11 levels; `question` names it |
| 422 | `input_budget_exceeded` | Longer than `--decision-ctx`, or than a Jev-Style model's budgets; `question` names the question when it was one question's. Nothing was truncated |
| 422 | `policy_denied` | The server's [decision policy](#a-server-side-decision-policy-eullm_decision_policy) leaves a `choice` question fewer than two options; `question` names it |
| 409 | `traces_disabled` | Feedback sent to a server with [decision traces](#decision-traces-eullm_decision_traces) off |
| 400 | `model_not_loaded` | No `model`, or a System One name such as `jev-latest`, and no decision model loaded |
| 404 | `not_found` | `model` names a model the server does not have |
| 401 / 403 / 429 | `unauthorized` / `forbidden` / `too_many_requests` | Refused by the API key, IP allowlist or origin checks, or over the key's quota |
| 405 / 413 / 415 | `method_not_allowed` / `payload_too_large` / `unsupported_media_type` | Not a `POST`, a body over the limit, not `Content-Type: application/json` |
| 500 | `internal_error` | The model failed to load, or llama.cpp failed |

The other endpoints keep the error bodies Ollama and OpenAI clients read.

**Which model.** Preferably one trained for this endpoint, a
[Jev-Style model](#jev-style-decision-models): calibrated by its authors, up
to 255 options, and an order of magnitude steadier than an instruction-tuned
model at the same quantization (see the table above). A small
instruction-tuned model also works: Qwen3 0.6B–4B from the catalog are the
intended size. It must be able to answer without reasoning first; a model
that always opens a reasoning block (the DeepSeek-R1 family) spends its
first token on the tag, and every answer's `coverage` shows it.

**The decision slot.** The model lives in a third slot, next to the
generation and embedding models, with the same residency rules as the
embedding slot: loaded next to the generation model when it fits, the
generation model evicted first when it does not. What counts is the weights
plus a request's context — its KV cache at `--decision-ctx` and a compute
buffer. The model keeps that context between requests, sized by the largest
request so far, and releases it before a generation model is sized, so the
sizing sees it as reserved, not as used. `--decision-model <path-or-name>`
loads it at startup as a reserved companion, exactly like
`--embedding-model`: `--fit` keeps its context's VRAM free and a chat-model
swap never evicts it.

**The same state again costs only the questions.** The context keeps the
state the last request decoded. A request whose shared part is token for
token the same — the next round of questions an agent asks about the same
document — starts from it instead of decoding the state again, and reports
`prefix_reused: true`, with `evaluated_tokens` counting only what was
decoded. It changes no answer: the questions land in the same cells, in
batches of the same shape, as they would from a freshly decoded state (and
`--order-check` in the benchmark checks exactly that). A request about
another state replaces the one kept.

```bash
eullm serve --decision-model qwen3-1.7b --decision-ctx 16384
```

The `model` field may name any model the server can load (it then loads into
the decision slot). Left out, or set to a System One model name such as
`jev-latest`, it means the decision model already loaded — so a Jev client
works unchanged. With no decision model loaded the request is refused with a
400 `model_not_loaded` saying so.

Every decision is written to the audit trail with `request_type:
"systemone"` and a `decision` record: each answer with its log-probabilities
and its probabilities before and after calibration. The state itself is not
stored, only its SHA-256; its text, redacted, goes only to the
[decision traces](#decision-traces-eullm_decision_traces), when they are on.

**A client that disconnects.** The record is written by the thread that
computed the decision, not by the connection that asked for it, so every
decision the model computes is recorded — one whose client disconnected
before its answers were ready with `client_disconnected: true`, since they
were never sent. A request whose client disconnects before that stops at its
next question, or before it starts if it was still waiting for the model, so
the next request does not wait behind work nobody will read. It decided
nothing and, like a request refused as invalid or one llama.cpp failed on, is
not recorded; the server log says it was abandoned. A single question is not
interrupted once it is being decoded.

### A server-side decision policy (`EULLM_DECISION_POLICY`)

Some options must never be chosen, whatever a model makes of the state: a
tool that deletes data, a transfer of money, anything that touches
production. The decision policy takes them out of every request before the
model reads it. Code filters, the model judges: an option the policy denies
is removed from the question, not vetoed after the model picked it, so the
model chooses among the options that remain and their probabilities add up
without it. A model shown an option it must not take can prefer it whatever
the state says: offered a way to the food that ended in a trap, the
Jev-Style 0.8B took it 20 times out of 20 in the Snake example.

`EULLM_DECISION_POLICY` names a JSON file, read once at startup, from the
environment first and the `.env` file second, like the other perimeter
settings:

```json
{ "version": 1, "deny_options": ["delete_*", "transfer_funds", "*_prod"] }
```

- `deny_options` is matched against the option names of every `choice`
  question. `*` stands for any run of characters, none included; everything
  else is literal. Case does not count, nor do spaces around a name:
  `delete_*` denies `Delete_All` as well. Descriptions are not matched, and
  `noul` and `score` questions have no options to deny.
- The response lists what was removed, per question, in
  `eullm.policy_removed` (`{"action": ["delete_account"]}`), and so does the
  decision's audit record. The field is absent when the policy removed
  nothing; a request it removes nothing from is answered exactly as without a
  policy.
- A question left with fewer than two options is refused with a 422
  `policy_denied` that names the question and the options denied: what
  remains is not a choice. A client's own mistakes come first — a `choice`
  sent with one option is still an `invalid_question`.
- `version` is required and must be `1`. A file written for a later version
  may hold rules this engine does not know, and applying only the others
  would silently leave those out. A file that cannot be read or applied as
  written — missing, not JSON, an unknown key, an empty pattern, a later
  version — stops the server at startup instead of letting every option
  through. The startup log prints the patterns and where they came from;
  restart the server to change them.

### Decision traces (`EULLM_DECISION_TRACES`)

Training a decision model on the decisions it is actually asked to make
needs the text of those decisions, and the audit trail does not keep it, on
purpose: it records every decision's state as a SHA-256 only. Traces are
the explicit place for that text. They are off unless
`EULLM_DECISION_TRACES` names a directory (from the environment first and
the `.env` file second), they stay on the machine, and personal data is
redacted before anything is written.

```bash
EULLM_DECISION_TRACES=/data/traces eullm serve --decision-model jev-style-0.8b-decision-v3-gguf-q4_k_m
```

`decisions.jsonl` in that directory gets one line for every decision the
audit trail records — the same decisions, those whose client had gone
included — and nothing for a request that was refused or abandoned:

| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| `schema` | `1`, the version of this shape. A change that would break a reader of it gets a new number |
| `id` | The audit record's `id`, which the response gave as `eullm.audit_id`: the same decision in the audit trail, and what feedback names it by |
| `timestamp` | The audit record's, RFC 3339 in UTC |
| `model` | The decision model, named as in the audit record |
| `readout` | `codes` or `verdict` |
| `mode` | `shared_prefix`, `batched` or `separate` |
| `state` | The state as the model read it: text as it is; a structured state as the readout writes it (indented JSON for `codes`, one line for `verdict`), its values redacted, so it is still JSON |
| `questions` | Each question as the model read it, after the decision policy, in the shape of a request: `type`, `instructions` (structured instructions as the compact JSON the model read) and `criteria` — `{"true": …, "false": …}` for `noul`, `""` where the question said nothing; option → description for `choice`, `""` for none; for `score`, each level as the model read it |
| `answers` | Each answer as the response returned it, without its `eullm` object: `noul`; `choice`, `probabilities`, `confidence`; `score`, `legend`, `probabilities`, `confidence` |
| `policy_removed` | Per question, the options the decision policy removed; `{}` when none |
| `client_disconnected` | `true` when the answers were computed after the client had gone, and never sent |

Every key is on every line. A line from the Jev-Style 0.8B on a CPU, wrapped
here, for a ticket that named a card number, an IBAN and a mobile number, on
a server whose policy denies `delete_*` and `transfer_funds`:

```json
{"schema": 1, "id": "b1149e83-332b-48c0-bab7-53725922c4de", "timestamp": "2026-10-01T13:35:34.529683343Z",
 "model": "Jev-Style-0.8B-Decision-v3-Q4_K_M", "readout": "verdict", "mode": "shared_prefix",

 "questions": {
   "is_urgent": {"type": "noul", "instructions": "Does the customer need an answer today?", "criteria": {"true": "", "false": ""}},
   "action": {"type": "choice", "instructions": "What should the support agent do?",
              "criteria": {"refund": "Refund the duplicate charge", "ask_human": "Hand the ticket to a person"}},
   "severity": {"type": "score", "instructions": "How severe is the problem?",
                "criteria": ["Cosmetic", "Degraded, with a workaround", "Blocking"]}},

   "is_urgent": {"type": "noul", "noul": 0.525160129126831},

              "probabilities": {"refund": 0.8943443753775355, "ask_human": 0.1056556246224647}, "confidence": 0.788688750755071},
   "severity": {"type": "score", "score": 1.400225522364445,
                "legend": {"0": "Cosmetic", "1": "Degraded, with a workaround", "2": "Blocking"},
                "probabilities": {"0": 0.03265542390587039, "1": 0.5344636298238142, "2": 0.4328809462703154},

 "policy_removed": {"action": ["transfer_funds", "delete_account"]},
 "client_disconnected": false}
```

**What is redacted.** Every text on the line — the state, instructions,
descriptions, levels and legend — has six kinds of personal data replaced
by a placeholder:

| Placeholder | What | Recognised |
|---|---|---|
| `[EMAIL]` | E-mail addresses | `name@domain.tld`, international letters included |
| `[PHONE]` | Phone numbers | With `+` or `00` and a country code, any country: `+39 333 1234567`, `+44 20 7946 0958`, `+1 (202) 555-0123`. Italian ones without it: a mobile, ten digits from a 3 (`333 1234567`, `333-123-4567`); a landline, 8 to 11 digits from a 0 (`06 1234 5678`, `(02) 12345678`) |
| `[IBAN]` | IBANs | Any country, whole, in groups of four, or by its parts as Italian documents print it (`IT 60 X 05428 11101 000000123456`), when the check digits match |
| `[CF]` | Italian codici fiscali | By their structure, omocodia included, so a mistyped check letter is caught too |
| `[CARD]` | Payment card numbers | 13 to 19 digits starting with 2 to 6, whole or in the groups cards are printed in, when the Luhn check passes |
| `[IP]` | IPv4 addresses | Four numbers from 0 to 255 joined by dots |

Dates, times, amounts, years, article numbers (`art. 2043 c.c.`,
`d.lgs. 196/2003`) and other numbers are left as they are.

It is pattern matching, and it misses things:

- Names, street addresses, dates of birth and every identifier not in the
  table — an identity card or passport number, a licence plate, an IPv6
  address, a partita IVA — stay as written.
- So does anything in the table written in a form it does not expect:
  `mario at example dot com`, a foreign number without its `+`
  (`(202) 555-0123`), a codice fiscale split by spaces, an IBAN or a card
  number with a wrong check digit.
- Question ids and option names are written as they are, as in the audit
  trail: they are what the answers and the feedback refer to, and redacting
  them could turn two options into one. Keep personal data out of them.

And it errs the other way: a four-part version number (`1.2.3.4`) becomes
`[IP]`; a code of 13 to 19 digits that happens to pass the Luhn check — one
in ten do — becomes `[CARD]`; ten digits from a 3, or 8 to 10 from a 0,
become `[PHONE]`. Treat the files as what they are: the text of the
decisions, less what the patterns catch.

**A trace that cannot be written** — a full disk, a directory removed —
never fails the decision: it is still made, audited and answered, and the
server log says the trace is missing. A directory that cannot be written at
startup stops the server instead, since whoever set the variable asked for
the traces. The file grows with every decision; move it away to start a new
one, and the next decision creates it again.

### Feedback (`POST /v1/systemone/feedback`)

A model trained on its own answers learns nothing it did not already know;
what teaches it is the answer that would have been right.
`POST /v1/systemone/feedback` records that for a decision, named by the
`eullm.audit_id` its response carried — from a person reviewing it, a rule
that knows better, or a larger model acting as teacher:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:11434/v1/systemone/feedback -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
  "id": "094cd37b-9db6-4b58-acb7-54fb92f32a29",
  "answers": { "action": "refund", "is_urgent": true, "severity": 2 },
  "outcome": "Rimborsato il 02/10; il cliente ha confermato da mario.rossi@example.com",
  "source": "user"
}'
```

```json
{"id": "094cd37b-9db6-4b58-acb7-54fb92f32a29", "recorded": true}
```

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `id` | Required. The decision's `eullm.audit_id` |
| `answers` | Required. Question id → the answer that was right: an option's name for a `choice`, `true` or `false` for a `noul`, the level's index from 0 for a `score`. Only the questions there is something to say about; `{}` when the feedback gives an `outcome` alone |
| `outcome` | Optional. What came of the decision, as text, up to 16 KB |
| `source` | Optional. Who says so: `user`, `rule` or `teacher` |

It is appended to `feedback.jsonl`, next to `decisions.jsonl`, as one line
with every key, `null` for what was not given:

| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| `schema` | `1` |
| `kind` | `feedback` |
| `timestamp` | When the feedback was received, RFC 3339 in UTC |
| `id` | The decision's audit id, in lower case: the `id` of its line in `decisions.jsonl` |
| `answers` | As sent, in the order sent |
| `outcome` | As sent, redacted like every text in the traces, or `null` |
| `source` | As sent, or `null` |

The line the request above wrote:

```json
{"schema":1,"kind":"feedback","timestamp":"2026-10-01T13:49:08.356674032Z","id":"094cd37b-9db6-4b58-acb7-54fb92f32a29","answers":{"action":"refund","is_urgent":true,"severity":2},"outcome":"Rimborsato il 02/10; il cliente ha confermato da [EMAIL]","source":"user"}
```

Several feedbacks on one decision are several lines, and whoever reads them
decides which counts: the latest, or a person's over a rule's.

The server checks a feedback's shape, not its sense. Types and sizes are
checked — at most 64 answers, question ids and option names up to 1 KB, an
unknown key refused — and a wrong answer is refused with a 422
`invalid_question` naming its question. But the server keeps no index of
past decisions, so whether `id` names a decision in the traces, and whether
`"refund"` is one of that question's options, is for whoever joins the two
files to check. With traces off there is nowhere to keep a feedback, and the
endpoint answers 409 `traces_disabled`. It sits behind the same API key, IP
allowlist and origin checks as `/v1/systemone`, and its errors take the same
shape.

### Jev-Style decision models

[Jev-Style](https://github.com/lawrence3699/jev-style) (Apache-2.0)
publishes Qwen3.5 fine-tunes trained for the three question types of this
endpoint, and they read an answer differently — the *verdict readout*. Every
option is followed by a ` ->` slot, and the option's score is
`logit(" yes") − logit(" no")` at its slot. The options are all read in the
same pass, not as competing codes, so a `choice` can have up to 255 of them.
The probabilities are `softmax(scores / T)`, with the temperature `T` fitted
on held-out data and released with the model. It is applied by default; a
request's `temperature` overrides it, and `1` gives the probabilities of the
raw scores.

| Model | Input | Get it |
|---|---|---|
| Jev-Style-0.8B-Decision-v3 (0.53 GB in Q4_K_M) | Causal attention; question, options and slots within 2,048 tokens | `eullm pull hf.co/chaoliangUNSW/Jev-Style-0.8B-Decision-v3-GGUF:Q4_K_M` |
| Jev-Style-2B-Decision-v3 (1.3 GB in Q4_K_M) | Block-causal attention over 2,048-token blocks; options that do not fit one block become a numbered catalogue | `eullm pull hf.co/chaoliangUNSW/Jev-Style-2B-Decision-v3-GGUF:Q4_K_M` |

```bash
eullm pull hf.co/chaoliangUNSW/Jev-Style-0.8B-Decision-v3-GGUF:Q4_K_M
eullm serve --decision-model jev-style-0.8b-decision-v3-gguf-q4_k_m --decision-ctx 25600
```

The server recognizes such a model when it loads, in one of two ways:

- from the `readout_config.json` released with the model, when that file
  sits next to the GGUF;
- otherwise from the model's name (`general.name`) — the case of a GGUF
  pulled on its own.

The load log says which and prints the temperature.

**The input is the one the model was trained on.** It is not a chat
prompt. The input is rebuilt token for token: each segment tokenized on
its own, with text never parsed for special tokens, and a structured
state serialized the way the release's runtime writes JSON. It is
computed the way that runtime computes it: the same micro-batches, flash
attention off on the CPU for the 2B, and one block per decode call for
the block-causal attention.

This was checked against that runtime, Q4_K_M on the CPU, on 24 cases for
the 0.8B and 28 for the 2B:

- short, JSON, long, and special-token-laden states;
- every question type, up to 30 options — and 70 in the 2B's numbered
  catalogue form.

The token ids were identical and, in `separate` mode, the scores agreed to
4e-16, asked one at a time and all together.

**Differences from the code readout:**

- `content_free` calibration is refused, since the model brings its own.
- `eullm.scores` replaces `eullm.logprobs`, and there is no `coverage`:
  every option is read at a slot of its own.
- Input over 25,600 tokens, or options that do not fit the model's
  budget, is refused rather than truncated. Raise `--decision-ctx` to
  25600 to allow the longest input the models accept.
- Only the release's global temperature is applied, as its own runtime
  does when it is not given a category — also when the GGUF carries an
  `eullm.decision.temperature`, which a code-readout model would use.

`shared_prefix` decodes the state once, as with any model, and each
question on its own after it:

- **2B:** its input is cut into 2,048-token blocks at the end of the state
  anyway, so sharing the state changes no score: `shared_prefix` gives the
  runtime's scores exactly, on the CPU and on an RTX 5070 Ti. It decodes one
  block per call, so its `batched` requests are answered, and reported, as
  `shared_prefix`.
- **0.8B:** its arithmetic depends on where a 1,024-token micro-batch
  starts, because its recurrent layers are computed in chunks from there,
  and sharing the state moves where its questions' micro-batches start. Its
  `shared_prefix` scores are therefore within the model's own noise of the
  runtime's: up to 0.025 in probability on the CPU, 0.039 on an RTX 5070 Ti.
  `separate` gives them exactly, at the cost of decoding the state again for
  every question: 64 questions about a 1,024-token state take 0.62 s on an
  RTX 5070 Ti in `shared_prefix` mode, 3.2 s in `separate`.

### jev-style with EuLLM: MCP server, CLI, Python client

[jev-style](https://github.com/lawrence3699/jev-style) (Apache-2.0,
`pip install jev-style`) is the Jev-Style models' own toolkit: an MCP
server, a command line, a Python client and a guard for a coding
agent's tool calls, all of which talk to any server that answers
`POST /v1/systemone`. Point them at
EuLLM with `JEV_STYLE_URL`. EuLLM must have a decision model loaded, with
`--decision-model`: jev-style's guard names its own model
(`jev-style-0.8b-decision-v3`) and its other tools name none, and EuLLM
reads both, as it reads every `jev…` name, as the decision model it has
loaded.

```bash
eullm pull hf.co/chaoliangUNSW/Jev-Style-0.8B-Decision-v3-GGUF:Q4_K_M
eullm serve --port 11500 --decision-model jev-style-0.8b-decision-v3-gguf-q4_k_m
```

The MCP server gives an agent `decide`, `noul`, `choice`, `score` and
`model_info` as tools. In Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add jev-style --scope user -e JEV_STYLE_URL=http://localhost:11500 -- uvx jev-style@0.3.0 mcp
```

In Cursor, Claude Desktop and other clients configured with an
`mcpServers` block:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jev-style": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["jev-style@0.3.0", "mcp"],
      "env": { "JEV_STYLE_URL": "http://localhost:11500" }
    }
  }
}
```

When EuLLM requires API keys (`EULLM_API_KEYS`), give one as
`JEV_STYLE_API_KEY` in the same `env` block (`-e JEV_STYLE_API_KEY=…` with
`claude mcp add`); jev-style sends it as a bearer token. The MCP server
talks only to a loopback address unless started with `--allow-remote`.

The command line and the client read the same variables:

```bash
export JEV_STYLE_URL=http://localhost:11500
jev-style decide "I was charged twice for March." --noul "This is about billing." \
  --choice "Which team?::billing,shipping,technical"
jev-style eval labelled.jsonl        # accuracy and calibration on your own labels
```

```python
from jev_style import JevStyle, choice, noul
js = JevStyle(base_url="http://localhost:11500")
js.decide("I was charged twice.", {"billing": noul("This is about billing."),
                                   "team": choice("Which team?", ["billing", "shipping"])})
```

The guard (`jev-style guard`, a `PreToolUse` hook that checks each tool
call before it runs) takes the
server from `JEV_STYLE_GUARD_URL` or `JEV_STYLE_URL`, else from `server_url`
in its `guard_config.json`. It gives up after `timeout_s` (8 seconds by default)
and then asks the user instead; on a slow CPU raise it. A request it gives
up on stops at EuLLM's next question, and a decision already computed is in
the audit trail with `client_disconnected: true`.

What differs from jev-style's own server:

- **Probabilities** are calibrated with the release's global temperature
  (0.880 for the 0.8B, 0.828 for the 2B). jev-style's server uses instead
  the temperature fitted for typed questions of the same kind where the
  release has one: for the 0.8B, 0.98 to 1.01 for yes/no questions and for
  choices and scores of 3 to 5 options, whose probabilities it therefore
  gives a little less sharp; the 2B has none. The scores underneath,
  `eullm.scores`, are the same.
- **A `choice` with one option** is refused (see the limits above).
- **Errors** carry EuLLM's messages, in jev-style's shape.

## API Reference

The Engine exposes two sets of endpoints: the native EULLM API (Ollama-compatible) and an OpenAI-compatible API. CORS is enabled for browser-based tools.

}
```

Besides Ollama's `version`, EuLLM reports the API port, `model_swaps` (models
evicted to make room in another slot), and the [resident
models](#several-models-at-once): the `--max-loaded-models` limit, how many
generation models are loaded, and how many were unloaded to make room for
another.

#### `GET /api/tags`

List available models. Returns the loaded models first, the most recently used first, each with `"loaded": true` (what admin dashboards check for health), followed by catalog entries and the other models in the store. `GET /api/ps` lists only what is loaded, with what each model holds. With `--auto-model`, `auto` comes last, with `details.family: "eullm-router"` and `details.candidates`.

```bash
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
```

```json
{
  "models": [
    {
      "name": "eullm/legal-it-4b",
      "size": 4500000000,
      "digest": "sha256:le7a1it0...",
      "details": {
        "format": "gguf",
        "family": "qwen3",
        "parameter_size": "12B",
        "quantization_level": "Q4_K_M",
        "domain": "legal",
        "source_model": "Qwen/Qwen3-14B"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### `POST /api/generate`

Generate text from a prompt. Uses real llama.cpp inference.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:11434/api/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "eullm/legal-it-4b", "prompt": "Cosa dice l'\''art. 2043 del Codice Civile?"}'
```

```json
{
  "model": "eullm/legal-it-4b",
  "created_at": "2026-03-21T10:00:00Z",
  "response": "L'articolo 2043 del Codice Civile...",
  "done": true,
  "done_reason": "stop",
  "total_duration": 1500000000,
  "load_duration": 0,
  "prompt_eval_count": 15,
  "prompt_eval_duration": 0,
  "eval_count": 128,
  "eval_duration": 1200000000
}
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `model` | loaded model | Model name |
| `prompt` | (required) | Input prompt |
| `max_tokens` / `num_predict` | 512 | Maximum tokens to generate (see note below) |
| `temperature` | 0.7 | Sampling temperature |
| `stream` | true | Stream response token-by-token (NDJSON) |
| `num_ctx` | server per-slot ctx | Per-request context window budget (clamped to per-slot max) |
| `format` | — | Set to `"json"` for constrained JSON decoding (GBNF grammar) |
| `keep_alive` | `--keep-alive` | How long the model stays loaded once this request is over: a duration (`"5m"`), a number of seconds, `0` to unload it as soon as the answer has been sent, `-1` to keep it. Counted from when the model goes idle, with the keep_alive of the last request that arrived — as in Ollama, so a `keep_alive: 0` sent while an answer is still coming unloads the model once it is over |
| `cache_prompt` | true | EuLLM extension, llama.cpp's name: `false` decodes the whole prompt instead of starting from what the slot holds from the request before. Slower for a long conversation, but on a GPU the only way the same request gets the same answer twice at temperature 0 (see below). Also on `/api/chat` and `/v1/chat/completions`, at the top level or in `options` |
| `options` | — | Ollama-style nested object for `num_predict`, `temperature`, `num_ctx` |

**Same request, same answer.** Temperature 0 (or `top_k: 1`) with a `seed` picks the same token from the same numbers, but on a GPU the numbers themselves depend on how many of a prompt's tokens are decoded together, and by default a request starts from the part of the prompt its slot already holds from the request before. The same request can then get a different answer depending on what came before it, or on whether the model was reloaded in between — in AutoBench on an RTX 5070 Ti, half of qwen3-8b's GSM8K answers came out different the second time they were asked. A CPU decodes the same way whatever the batch, so this is a GPU matter. Send `"cache_prompt": false` when answers must reproduce (evaluations, comparisons, tests): AutoBench does for every answer it compares.

**Ollama `options` support:** Parameters can be passed at the top level (OpenAI style) or nested inside an `options` object (Ollama style). Top-level values take precedence.

```json
{
  "prompt": "Ciao!",
  "options": {
    "num_predict": 1024,
    "temperature": 0.5,
    "num_ctx": 8192
  }
}
```

**`num_predict` capping:** If `num_predict` (or `max_tokens`) would exceed the remaining context budget (`effective_ctx - prompt_tokens`), it is automatically capped. The Engine logs a `WARN` when this happens — see the [Logging & Troubleshooting](#logging--troubleshooting) section.

**Streaming:** When `"stream": true` (the default), the response is sent as **NDJSON** (newline-delimited JSON). Each line is a complete JSON object with `"response"` (the token) and `"done": false`. The final line has `"done": true` with timing stats. Content-Type is `application/x-ndjson`.

**Loading and unloading without generating**, as in Ollama: an empty `prompt`
(or, on `/api/chat`, empty `messages`) loads the model and answers
`"done_reason": "load"`. With `"keep_alive": 0` it unloads that model instead
— only that one, the others staying loaded — and answers
`"done_reason": "unload"`; a model that is not loaded is not loaded first.
Answering other requests, the model goes when they are over.

```bash
# Streaming example (NDJSON — same format as Ollama)
curl -N http://localhost:11434/api/generate \
  -d '{"model": "local", "prompt": "Hello", "stream": true}'
# Each line: {"model":"...","response":"token","done":false}
# Final line: {"model":"...","response":"","done":true,"done_reason":"stop",...}
```

#### `POST /api/chat`

Chat completion with message history. Messages are formatted as ChatML internally. Supports `"stream": true` for token-by-token NDJSON streaming (same format as Ollama).

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:11434/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "eullm/legal-it-4b",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Spiegami il GDPR in breve."}
    ]
  }'

# Streaming
curl -N http://localhost:11434/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "eullm/legal-it-4b",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Ciao!"}],
    "stream": true
  }'
```

#### `GET /api/ps`

The models in memory, in Ollama's shape: every generation model, the most
recently used first, then the embedding and decision models.

```bash
curl http://localhost:11434/api/ps
```

```json
{
  "models": [
    {
      "name": "qwen3-8b",
      "model": "qwen3-8b",
      "size": 5603000000,
      "digest": "sha256:…",
      "details": {
        "parent_model": "",
        "format": "gguf",
        "family": "qwen3",
        "families": ["qwen3"],
        "parameter_size": "8.2B",
        "quantization_level": "Q4_K_M"
      },
      "expires_at": "2026-10-01T15:42:07.512+00:00",
      "size_vram": 5410000000,
      "context_length": 4096,
      "eullm": {
        "slot": "generation",
        "in_flight": 0,
        "last_used": "2026-10-01T15:37:07.512+00:00",
        "batch_size": 1,
        "gpu_layers": -1,
        "reserved_companion": false,
        "launch": false,
        "size_vram_measured": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

- `size` is the model's weights, its projector and its KV cache; `size_vram`
  what free VRAM lost when it loaded (`eullm.size_vram_measured`), or an
  estimate from its layers on the GPU when that could not be measured.
- `expires_at` is when its keep_alive runs out once it is idle; a model kept
  for good gets a date centuries ahead, as in Ollama, never `null`.
- `context_length` is what one request gets: a scheduler's context is shared
  by its `batch_size` slots.
- `eullm` is EuLLM's own: which slot holds the model, how many requests it is
  answering, when it was last used, and whether it is a reserved companion
  (`--embedding-model`, `--decision-model`) or the model `eullm run` started
  with.

#### `POST /api/unload`

EuLLM extension: unload generation models now, freeing their VRAM. With a body
`{"model": "qwen3-8b"}`, that model only; without one, every generation model.
Requests still running on an unloaded model are cut off — to let them finish
first, send an empty request with `"keep_alive": 0` instead (see above).

```json
{ "unloaded": "qwen3-8b", "unloaded_all": ["qwen3-8b"] }
```

`unloaded` names the first model unloaded, or is `null` when none was loaded —
which is not an error — and `unloaded_all` lists every one.

#### `POST /api/route`

Which model [`"model": "auto"`](#model-auto-the-decision-model-chooses-the-model)
would choose for a request, without generating anything or loading a
generation model. An EuLLM extension. The body is the request as it would go
to `/api/chat`, `/v1/chat/completions` (`messages`, and `tools`) or
`/api/generate` (`prompt`); `batch_size` and `ctx_size` are read as there.
Without `--auto-model` it answers 404; a body with neither `messages` nor
`prompt` gets a 400.

```bash
curl http://localhost:11434/api/route -d '{"model": "auto",
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Prove that the square root of 2 is irrational."}]}'
```

```json
{
  "model": "qwen3-8b",
  "reason": "decided",
  "fallback": "qwen3-8b",
  "candidates": [
    {"model": "qwen3-4b", "description": "Short everyday requests, ...", "probability": 0.22, "resident": true},
    {"model": "qwen3-8b", "description": "Multi-step reasoning, ...", "probability": 0.78, "resident": true}
  ],
  "excluded": [],
  "confidence": 0.56,
  "decision_model": "Jev-Style-0.8B-Decision-v3-Q4_K_M",
  "decision_ms": 31.4,
  "state": "Request to answer, with its context. ...",
  "question": {"type": "choice", "instructions": "Which model should answer the latest message? ...",
               "criteria": {"qwen3-4b": "Short everyday requests, ...", "qwen3-8b": "Multi-step reasoning, ..."}},
  "route_id": "<uuid>"
}
```

`candidates` are the ones offered, in order; `excluded` the others, with
why. `state` and `question` are exactly what the decision model read, in
`/v1/systemone`'s request shape, so the same question worded otherwise can be
asked of `/v1/systemone` about the same state. Each call is audited as a
`route` line with `"dry_run": true`.

#### `POST /api/show`

Get model metadata.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:11434/api/show \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "eullm/legal-it-4b"}'
```

#### `POST /api/pull`

Trigger a model download.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:11434/api/pull \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "eullm/legal-it-4b"}'
```

#### `POST /api/embed`

Embed one or more texts. `input` accepts a single string or an array. See
[Text Embeddings and the Embedding Slot](#text-embeddings-and-the-embedding-slot)
for how this coexists with the generation model.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:11434/api/embed \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "bge-m3", "input": ["first chunk", "second chunk"]}'
```

```json
{
  "model": "bge-m3",
  "embeddings": [[0.013, -0.021, ...], [0.008, 0.044, ...]],
  "total_duration": 41250000,
  "load_duration": 120000,
  "prompt_eval_count": 8
}
```

As in Ollama, `prompt_eval_count` is the tokens the model read, over all
inputs and after truncation to the embedder's context, and the durations
are nanoseconds: `load_duration` getting the model into its slot (next to
nothing when it was already there), `total_duration` the whole request.

### OpenAI-Compatible API

These endpoints allow using EULLM as a drop-in backend for any tool that supports the OpenAI API: Open WebUI, LangChain, LlamaIndex, n8n, Flowise, etc.

#### `GET /v1/models`

List models in OpenAI format.

```bash
curl http://localhost:11434/v1/models
```

When a decision model is loaded, it is listed for System One clients too —
jev-style's `model_info` tool and the System One SDKs' `models.list()`.
Its entry in `data` carries `context_tokens`, the most tokens one
`/v1/systemone` request may hold (`--decision-ctx`, or less when the model
itself reads fewer), for a Jev-Style model `head_max_tokens`, what one
question with its options may take on its own, and `"eullm": {"slot":
"decision"}`; and the top-level `models`, the list the System One SDKs read,
names it. With no decision model loaded, `models` is empty. With
`--auto-model`, `auto` is the last entry of `data`.

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [
    { "id": "qwen3-4b", "object": "model", "created": 1700000000, "owned_by": "eullm" },
    { "id": "Jev-Style-0.8B-Decision-v3-Q4_K_M", "object": "model", "created": 1700000000,
      "owned_by": "eullm", "context_tokens": 8192, "head_max_tokens": 2048,
      "eullm": { "slot": "decision", "readout": "verdict" } },
    ...
  ],
  "models": [
    { "name": "Jev-Style-0.8B-Decision-v3-Q4_K_M", "release_date": "2026-09-24",
      "description": "Jev-Style-0.8B-Decision-v3 on EuLLM: typed decisions (noul / choice / score)" }
  ]
}
```

#### `POST /v1/chat/completions`

Chat completion in OpenAI format. Real inference with token counts. Supports `"stream": true` for SSE streaming (OpenAI `chat.completion.chunk` format with `[DONE]` terminator).

```bash
# Non-streaming
curl -X POST http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "eullm/legal-it-4b",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}
    ]
  }'

# Streaming (same format as OpenAI API)
curl -N http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "eullm/legal-it-4b",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
    "stream": true
  }'
```

```json
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-abc123",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1700000000,
  "model": "eullm/legal-it-4b",
  "choices": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "..."
      },
      "finish_reason": "stop"
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 10,
    "completion_tokens": 25,
    "total_tokens": 35
  }
}
```

**Output limit:** `max_completion_tokens`, the name OpenAI's Chat Completions
API now gives it, or `max_tokens`, the deprecated name older clients still
send. A request carrying both is limited by `max_completion_tokens`; a `null`
counts as not sent. Either name takes a non-negative integer, and any other
value means no limit. The limit counts every token the model generates, its
reasoning included, which is what OpenAI means by `max_completion_tokens`.
Without one the model generates until it stops or its context is full, and a
limit larger than the room left in the context is capped to it, as
[`num_predict`](#post-apigenerate) is. An answer cut short either way ends
with `"finish_reason": "length"`.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "eullm/legal-it-4b",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
    "max_completion_tokens": 256
  }'
```

#### `POST /v1/embeddings`

Embed one or more texts in OpenAI format. Same underlying embedding slot as
`/api/embed`.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:11434/v1/embeddings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "bge-m3", "input": "first chunk"}'
```

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [{"object": "embedding", "embedding": [0.013, -0.021, ...], "index": 0}],
  "model": "bge-m3",
  "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4, "total_tokens": 4}
}
```

`usage` counts the tokens the model read, after truncation to the
embedder's context; an embedding generates nothing, so the total is the
prompt.

#### `POST /v1/systemone`

Typed decisions (`noul`, `choice`, `score`) about a state, in the System One
API shape. Not an OpenAI endpoint; it sits under `/v1` because that is where
System One clients look for it. See
[Decisions: `/v1/systemone`](#decisions-v1systemone-and-the-decision-slot).

#### `POST /v1/systemone/feedback`

The answers that would have been right for a decision `/v1/systemone`
made, stored next to its trace when decision traces are on. See
[Feedback](#feedback-post-v1systemonefeedback).

## Model Catalog

The Engine ships with a built-in catalog of EU models:

| Model | Domain | Base | VRAM | Size | Languages |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `eullm/legal-it-4b` | Legal | Qwen3 | 6 GB | 4.5 GB | IT, EN |
| `eullm/medical-de-7b` | Medical | Qwen3 | 6 GB | 4.5 GB | DE, EN |
| `eullm/finance-fr-7b` | Finance | Qwen3 | 6 GB | 4.5 GB | FR, EN |
| `eullm/general-eu-7b` | General | Qwen3 | 6 GB | 4.5 GB | EN, IT, DE, FR, ES, PT, NL |
| `eullm/general-eu-14b` | General | Qwen3 | 10 GB | 8.5 GB | EN, IT, DE, FR, ES, PT, NL |
| `eullm/code-eu-14b` | Code | DeepSeek | 10 GB | 8.5 GB | EN, IT, DE, FR, ES |
| `eullm/legal-it-14b` | Legal | Qwen3 | 10 GB | 8.2 GB | IT, EN |

All models are Apache 2.0 or MIT licensed.

## Audit Trail

Every inference request is logged to a persistent JSONL file at `~/.eullm/audit/audit.jsonl`. Each line is a self-contained JSON object.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID v4 | Unique inference ID |
| `timestamp` | DateTime (UTC) | Request time |
| `model` | String | Model name |
| `request_type` | String | `generate`, `chat`, `chat.completions`, `systemone`, `route` |
| `input_tokens` | u32 | Input token count |
| `output_tokens` | u32 | Output token count |
| `duration_ms` | u64 | Inference duration |
| `user_id` | Option\<String\> | Optional user identifier |
| `decision` | Object, `systemone` only | `state_sha256`, `readout`, `mode`, `calibration`, `temperature`, `confidence_method` (`normalized_max_probability`; absent, and `normalized_entropy`, on lines written up to 0.7.20), `client_disconnected` (only when true: the answers were computed after the client had gone, and never sent), `policy_removed` (only when the [decision policy](#a-server-side-decision-policy-eullm_decision_policy) removed options: per question, the options the model never read), and per answer: `id`, `type`, `labels`, `logprobs` or `scores`, `raw_probabilities`, `probabilities`, `coverage`, `answer`, `confidence` |
| `routing` | Object, `route` only | How [`"model": "auto"`](#model-auto-the-decision-model-chooses-the-model) routed one request: `requested`, `model` (chosen), `reason`, `fallback`, `candidates` (offered, in order), `excluded` (with `why`), `decision_model`, `decision_ms`, `dry_run` (only for `POST /api/route`), `error`. The line's `id` is the route's id; its `model` is the decision model, and its `decision` the decision record as above |
| `route` | Object, routed answers only | `id` (the `route` line's), `requested` (`auto`), and `fallback` (`load_failed: …`, only when the chosen model did not load) |

**Example audit entry:**

```json
{"id":"a1b2c3d4-...","timestamp":"2026-03-21T14:30:00Z","model":"eullm/legal-it-4b","request_type":"chat","input_tokens":15,"output_tokens":128,"duration_ms":1200,"user_id":null}
```

The JSONL format allows:
- Append-only writes (crash-safe)
- Easy to grep, tail, stream
- Each line independently parseable
- Compatible with log analysis tools (Loki, ELK, etc.)

This provides the traceability required by the EU AI Act (Regulation 2024/1689).

## GPU Acceleration

| Feature flag | GPU backend | Build command |
|---|---|---|
| `cuda` | NVIDIA CUDA | `cargo build --release --features cuda` |
| `rocm` | AMD ROCm | `cargo build --release --features rocm` |
| `vulkan` | Cross-platform | `cargo build --release --features vulkan` |
| `metal` | Apple Silicon | `cargo build --release --features metal` |
| *(none)* | CPU only | `cargo build --release` |

How much of the model goes on the GPU is decided automatically on every
load — see [Automatic GPU sizing](#automatic-gpu-sizing) above. `--gpu-layers
0` forces CPU-only inference; `--gpu-layers N` caps the offload at N layers.
Sizing needs a CUDA build to read free VRAM; on the other backends
`--gpu-layers` is used as given.

## Integration Examples

### With Open WebUI

```bash
# Start Engine
eullm run ./model.gguf

# In Open WebUI settings, set API URL to:
# http://localhost:11434
```

### With LangChain

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:11434/v1",
    model="eullm/legal-it-4b",
    api_key="not-needed"
)

response = llm.invoke("Spiegami l'art. 2043 del Codice Civile.")
```

### With curl

```bash
curl http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "local", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Ciao!"}]}'
```

## Logging & Troubleshooting

The Engine uses [`tracing`](https://docs.rs/tracing) for structured logging. Control verbosity with the `RUST_LOG` environment variable.

### Log levels

```bash
# Minimal (errors only)
RUST_LOG=error eullm run ./model.gguf

# Normal operation (recommended) — shows request params, context budget, cap warnings
RUST_LOG=eullm_engine=info eullm run ./model.gguf

# Verbose — adds prefill chunk details, decode loop, batch scheduling
RUST_LOG=eullm_engine=debug eullm run ./model.gguf

# Everything (very noisy, includes llama.cpp internals)
RUST_LOG=trace eullm run ./model.gguf
```

### What gets logged

| Level | Message | When |
|---|---|---|
| `INFO` | `Request params: max_tokens=N, temperature=T, num_ctx=X` | Every API request (routes layer) |
| `INFO` | `Seq N: prompt=P tokens, max_output=M, effective_ctx=C` | After tokenization (scheduler) |
| `INFO` | `Generate: prompt=P tokens, max_output=M, effective_ctx=C` | Sequential generate path |
| `INFO` | `Stream: prompt=P tokens, max_output=M, effective_ctx=C` | Sequential streaming path |
| `WARN` | `num_predict capped: requested=R, effective=E (context=C, prompt_tokens=P)` | When `num_predict` exceeds remaining context budget |
| `DEBUG` | `Prefilling seq N with P tokens in chunks of B` | Prefill chunking details (scheduler) |
| `DEBUG` | `Sequence N prefilled (P prompt tokens)` | After successful prefill |
| `ERROR` | `Prompt (P tokens) does not fit in context window (C)` | Prompt too long for context |

### Common issues

#### Truncated output / fewer tokens than expected

The model generates fewer tokens than `num_predict` requested.

**Diagnose:** Run with `RUST_LOG=eullm_engine=info` and look for the `WARN num_predict capped` message.

**Cause:** The prompt consumed most of the context window, leaving less room than `num_predict`.

**Fix:** Either:
- Increase `--ctx-size` on the server (requires more RAM/VRAM)
- Send `num_ctx` in the request to override per-request: `"num_ctx": 8192`
- Reduce prompt length
- Lower `num_predict` to match your actual needs

#### Prompt does not fit in context window

**Error:** `Prompt (N tokens) does not fit in context window (C)`

**Cause:** The tokenized prompt is longer than the effective context size.

**Fix:** Increase `--ctx-size` or send a shorter prompt. You can also pass `"num_ctx": 16384` per-request (clamped to server max).

#### Long generation latency on first request

**Cause:** The first prefill is slow because the KV cache is being allocated. Subsequent requests reuse allocated memory.

**Fix:** This is normal. For benchmarking, discard the first request as warmup.
