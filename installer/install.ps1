.SYNOPSIS
    Install, upgrade or uninstall EuLLM Engine on Windows.

.DESCRIPTION
    Quick install (PowerShell):

        irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eullm/eullm/main/installer/install.ps1 | iex

    Picks the CUDA build when an NVIDIA GPU the CUDA build covers (compute
    capability 8.6, 8.9 or 12.0) is present on driver 580+; the Vulkan build
    for another GPU Vulkan serves (an AMD Radeon, an Intel Arc, an NVIDIA card
    outside the CUDA build) when the graphics driver installed the Vulkan
    loader; and the CPU build otherwise. It verifies the download against the
    release's checksums.txt, installs into a per-user directory and adds it to
    the user PATH. No administrator rights are needed.

    Environment variables (all optional):

        EULLM_VERSION      Release to install, e.g. 0.7.9 (default: latest stable)
        EULLM_INSTALL_DIR  Install directory (default: %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\EuLLM)
        EULLM_VARIANT      cpu, cuda or vulkan, to skip GPU detection
        EULLM_UNINSTALL    Set to 1 to remove EuLLM and its PATH entry

    The Linux/macOS counterpart is installer/install.sh.
