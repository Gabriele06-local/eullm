"""The ways the RAG gate is decided.

Every method gives each case a `Decision`: a score that grows with how
likely the passages suffice, and, when the method makes one on its own,
its choice among `answer`, `retrieve_more` and `abstain`.

  * `embed-max`: the highest cosine similarity between the question and a
    passage — the signal a RAG system already has after retrieval. It
    decides nothing by itself: a threshold has to be fitted on labelled
    cases;
  * `reflex-gate`: `/v1/systemone`, the question and the passages as the
    state, one `choice` among the three;
  * `reflex-yesno`: the same state, one `noul`: do the passages hold every
    fact the answer needs?

The request the two Reflex methods send is built by `request` and their
`question`, and nothing else: `eullm-forge decisions import-rag` builds its
training traces with the same code, so a model trained on them is trained
on the prompt the gate shows it.
